summary: '"Following Darkness" by Forrest Reid is a novel written in the early 20th
  century. The narrative revolves around an unfinished autobiography of Peter Waring,
  a young man who reflects on his life, his friendships, and his experiences, particularly
  his relationship with the world of art and the influences that shape his identity.
  The book delves into Peter''s introspective thoughts, emotional struggles, and his
  ambivalence towards societal norms and personal connections.  The opening of "Following
  Darkness" presents a reflective Peter Waring, caught between the memories of his
  childhood and the present moment in Italy where he is staying. As he attempts to
  immerse himself in the task of writing, he finds himself instead reminiscing about
  his past, exploring themes of youth, art, and personal longing. The narrative is
  intertwined with encounters, such as the poignant memories of his friend Owen Gill
  and familial relationships that reveal Peter''s complex feelings towards love and
  creativity. Through a series of vivid impressions and experiences, Peter navigates
  his connections and aspirations, setting the stage for a deeper exploration of identity
  and artistic expression throughout the text. (This is an automatically generated
  summary.)'
