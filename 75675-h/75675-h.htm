<p>It is not without some hesitation that I offer to the public
the following fragment of an autobiography, even though
in doing so I am but obeying the obvious intention of its
author. When the papers of Mr. Peter Waring came into
my possession I had indeed no idea of its existence, and
I have now no means of telling when it was written. The
fact that he left it unfinished proves nothing. He may
have begun it and abandoned it years ago: he may have
been working at it shortly before his death. That he
intended to carry it to completion, there is, I think, abundant
evidence in a mass of detached notes and impressions
bearing on a later period of his life. These, rightly or
wrongly, I have not printed, partly because the earlier
portion has in itself a certain unity and completeness,
which would be marred were I to add anything to it, and
partly because they never received his personal revision.
Moreover, many of them are in the highest degree fantastic
and exotic, so that it is at times difficult to take them
literally, especially if the simplicity and directness of the
earlier pages be borne in mind.</p>

<p>Those who are familiar with Mr. Waring’s writings published
during his lifetime—writings in which the personal
element is so slight—will hardly be prepared for anything
so intimate as this journal. His critical methods were
entirely scientific. Of their value I am not the proper
person to speak, having neither the necessary knowledge,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
nor, to tell the whole truth, the necessary sympathy. Our
paths, if they seemed to run parallel for a moment, diverged
very early in life, and I could never take much interest in
the work to which he devoted his real, though, I venture
to think, somewhat narrow gifts. He was still a young
man—barely thirty-six—when he died, but he had already
become eminent in his own particular line, that of the
newer art criticism, invented, I believe, by the Italian,
Morelli. It was scarcely a career to bring him much under
the public eye, but his “Study of the Drawings of the
Early Italian Masters” gained him, I understand, the recognition
of a small number of persons, of various nationalities,
occupied in making similar researches. He was busy with
the proofs of the second and larger edition of this work
when, on the 10th of September, 1911, he died under tragic
circumstances. The mystery of his death, about which
there was some noise in the papers at the time, will, I think,
never now be cleared up, though, to my own mind, it is
perfectly clear that he was murdered.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>In relation to the autobiography, a word or two of
comment and explanation is possibly due to the reader.
To begin with, I have altered all the proper names save
two—my own, and that of Mrs. Carroll, of Derryaghy,
Newcastle, County Down, his oldest friend, which I have
allowed to remain. I feel this, myself, to be unsatisfactory,
but I cannot see how at present it is to be avoided. Again,
though I have added nothing, I have left out a few pages—only
a few—and none, I believe, of importance, so far as
the understanding of the whole is concerned. For this I
have no excuse to offer, except that it seemed to me that
he himself should have omitted them.</p>

<p>In the main the portrait he has given of himself coincides
with my own impression of him in early life. I can remember
very well when I first came to know him at school.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
I was more struck by his gifts then, perhaps, than I was
later, though even at that time he seemed to me to be
intensely one-sided. He was very intelligent, but from the
beginning his whole manner of looking upon life was, in
my opinion, unfortunate. It may sound harsh to say
so, but as the years passed I do not think he improved.
Latterly, he appeared to me to have little but his fine taste.
It was as if everything had become subservient to an
æsthetic sense, which was extraordinarily, morbidly acute.
Yet even while I write this I have a suspicion that I am
not doing him justice. If he had been nothing but what
I say he was, I should not be able to look back with tenderness
upon the friendship of those early days, whereas the
recollection of that friendship will always remain one of
the pleasantest memories of my life. I regret that it should
have been broken, but that was almost inevitable. It
came about slowly and naturally, though no doubt the
actual break was hastened by a mutual friend of ours, who
informed me that Waring had described me as borné and
tedious. That is the kind of thing which rankles. You
may say to yourself it is of no consequence, but to have
an uneasy feeling that your friend finds your company dull
quickly becomes unendurable. A man would rather be
thought almost anything than a bore; hence it was that
for a long time I entirely ceased to see him. I regret it
now, for he may never have made the fatal remark, and
even if he did, judging from his journal, it need not have
been inconsistent with affection.</p>

<p>The last time I saw him was at Mrs. Carroll’s house,
about a year before his death. She had asked me down,
I suppose by Waring’s request, and I went, though I stayed
only one night. I had not seen him for years until this
occasion, and I was struck, and even shocked, by his altered
appearance, and still more by his manner, which was that,
I imagined, of a man haunted by some secret thought that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
has come between him and everything about him. This
impression, though I do not desire to lay stress upon it,
may throw a light on certain of the later notes I have not
printed, and these, in turn, may afford some clue as to the
mystery surrounding his death, for it is evident that he
had come under the influence of strange and disreputable
persons, who professed to experiment in occult sciences—spiritualism,
and even magic. His hair had turned quite
white at the temples. He seemed restless and dissatisfied;
and, whatever else he may have found in his long wanderings,
I could not believe he had found peace.</p>

<p>Late in the evening we sat together. He was so silent
that I looked at him to see if he had fallen asleep. The
room we were sitting in—the morning-room—gave on to
a garden at the side of the house, into which one could
easily pass through tall French windows. The night was
warm, and one of these windows stood wide open, letting
in the scent of flowers, but with a curtain drawn across it
to keep out moths and other winged creatures attracted
by lamplight. I did not speak, but waited for him to talk
or to keep silent as he chose. After a while I got up to
examine a few black-framed etchings that hung upon the
walls. These, with some pieces of china, formed the only
decorations. I drew back the curtain and looked out into
the night. The moon was high above the trees, and I
could hear the low sound of waves breaking on the shore.
When I turned round he was watching me, and I was struck
by his expression, which was that of a man on the point
of making some very private communication. But perhaps
my sudden movement disconcerted him, for he said
nothing, and in a little I could see the impulse had left
him. I began to talk, not of my own work, which I thought
would have no interest for him, but of his, which I was
surprised to find he seemed to regard as equally unimportant.
I asked him what had first led him to take it up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span></p>

<p>“There was nothing else,” he answered.</p>

<p>Seeing that I waited for him to go on, he made an effort
to shake off his abstraction. “If I hadn’t found it I should
have bored myself to death. What is there for a boy of
eighteen, with no taste for society, and left to wander about
Europe alone, to do? Fortunately, I had always cared
for pictures, and early Italian art appealed to me particularly.”</p>

<p>“Of course, you had your writing.”</p>

<p>“I never wrote a line except to take notes. I was nearly
thirty before it occurred to me to publish anything. Even
then, it was only for a few pedants more or less like myself
that I wrote. My writings are of no account. The only
people I can imagine it pleasant to write for are quite young
people. They might lend your work a sort of charm by
reading their own youth and enthusiasm into it. But it
is not easy to arouse enthusiasm by describing how Bernardino
de’ Conti paints ears, or how Pontormo models
hands. For one thing, nobody wants to know. All that
it leads to is that presently you find yourself approaching
the most innocent work of art with the mind of a detective,
revelling in clues and the æsthetically unimportant. Nine-tenths
of your enjoyment comes from the gratified sense of
your own ingenuity. Of course it is wrong. When I was
a boy I fell in love with one of Giotto’s frescoes in the Upper
Church at Assisi, a thing half-peeled from the wall, and
representing Saint Francis preaching to the birds. But
why I liked it had nothing in the world to do either with
Giotto or Saint Francis. I simply saw a bit of decoration,
a Japanese print in gray and blue.... That is the proper
spirit. One day, however, a year or so later, I was in
the Louvre, in the Salle des Primitifs, and before me was
a beautiful little picture which hangs on the side wall, near
the door. Below it was printed an artist’s name, Gentile
da Fabriano. I looked at the picture again, and I said to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
myself, ‘Why Gentile, when it is obviously by Jacopo
Bellini?’ That was the beginning.”</p>

<p>“You don’t think, then, it matters very much?”</p>

<p>“About Gentile? Not in the least. I haven’t even
persuaded them to make the alteration in the catalogue.”</p>

<p>But I could see he was talking merely not to be silent,
so I got up and we lit our candles. At the top of the
staircase I said good-night, for our bedrooms were on
opposite sides of the house, but he pushed open a door.
“There is a picture here,” he said.</p>

<p>I followed him into the big, dark room, black shadows
that seemed almost solid gliding away before us. He took
my candle and held both up so that their light flickered
across a small canvas that hung just above the level of our
eyes. The painting represented the head of a quite young
girl, and I recognised it at once as a portrait of Katherine
Dale. I am no judge of pictures, so I will only say that
this picture gave me pleasure. Yet I should have hesitated
to call the face beautiful, and it certainly was not pretty.
It reminded me rather of an early Millais—that is to say,
the subject reminded me of a Millais type. There was the
same breadth of forehead, the same rich colouring and
steadfast, serious eyes that were more like the eyes of a
boy than of a girl. I wondered why he had brought me
in to look at it just now, and thought it had perhaps been
painted by a celebrated artist.</p>

<p>“Whose is it?” I asked, and was greatly surprised
when he told me he had done it himself, from memory.
I had never seen any of his work before, and I congratulated
him on his success, which seemed to me to be really
a genuine one. I asked another question, but he did not
reply. He merely returned me my candle, which I held up
for another look. The small, wavering, uncertain flame
lent a curious air of life to the portrait, and I continued
to regard it, for the frankness and simplicity of the young<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
face gave me great pleasure. When I glanced round I
discovered I was alone. My companion had disappeared
without my noticing it, and evidently he had gone out, not
by the way we had entered, but by another door at the
farther end of the room. That this was the case I had
more positive proof next moment, for a sudden draught
extinguished my candle so swiftly and unexpectedly that
I had an odd feeling that somebody had stolen up behind
me and blown it out.</p>

<p>What is there in this house, in these surroundings, so
utterly different from those I was born amongst, that
revives a swarm of memories of my childhood and youth?
My notes are piled up on the table before me, they have
been there for several days, and I have not touched them,
though I came here to work. A warm Italian sun floods
the stiff and formal garden stretching from my window,
with its pale paved walks, its fountain, and dark cypress-trees;
but when I shut my eyes, it is quite another garden
that I see, and now, when I have at last taken up my pen
to write, it is not to fulfil the task I had set myself, but to
chatter idly of a boyhood passed under other skies, grayer,
softer, and colder. The odd fact is that ever since my
arrival here, in spite of my being upon “classic soil,” in a
district rich in historical suggestion, and full, too, of the
colour and odour of the south, I have been communing
daily, hourly almost, with my own youth. I should like
to set down simply what that youth was, without embroidery,
without suppression, though, on the other hand,
a mere bald enumeration of the outward facts will be little
to my purpose. The facts in themselves are nothing.
Unless I can recapture the spirit that hovered behind them,
my task will have been fruitless, and even though in my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
effort to do so I shall probably accentuate it, alter it, clip
its wings and make it heavy, yet that must be my aim if
I am to write at all. I have little eloquence, and perhaps
no power of evocation, but the whole great, soft, time-toned
picture is before me at this moment, and I cannot
resist the temptation to linger over it. If I linger over it
pen in hand, what matter?</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>In the foreground there must be the portrait of a boy,
but painted in the manner of Rembrandt rather than
Bronzino. By this I mean there will be less of firm, clear
outline, than of light and shadow. The danger is that in
the end there may be too much shadow; but at least I
shall not, in the manner of a writer of fiction, have sacrificed
my subject for the sake of gaining an additional brightness
and vivacity. The spirit of youth is not merely bright and
vivacious; above all, it is not merely thoughtless and noisy.
It is melancholy, dreamy, passionate; it is admirable, and
it is base; it is full of curiosity; it is healthy, and it is
morbid; it is animal, and it is spiritual; sensual, yet filled
with vague half-realised yearnings after an ideal—that is
to say, it is the spirit of life itself, which can never be
adequately indicated by the description of a fight or of a
football match.</p>

<p>Of my earliest childhood I can form no consecutive picture;
I shall therefore pass over it quickly. Certain incidents
stand out with extraordinary vividness, but the chain
uniting them is wanting, and it is even impossible for me
to be quite sure as to the order in which they occurred.
Some are so trivial that I do not know why I should remember
them; others, at the time, doubtless, more important,
have now lost their significance; and countless others,
again, I must have completely forgotten. But it occurs
to me, on looking back deliberately, that I have changed
very little from what I was in those first years. I have
developed, but what I was then I am now, what I cared
for then I care for now. In other words, like everybody
else, I came into this world a mere bundle of inherited
instincts, for the activity of which I was no more responsible
than for the falling of last night’s rain.</p>

<p>Of the dawning of consciousness I have no recollection
whatever. Back farther than anything else there reach
two impressions—one, of being set to dance naked on a
table, amid the laughter of women, and the rhythmic
clapping of their hands; the other, probably later in date,
of what must have been a house-cleaning, stamped on my
mind by an inexplicable fear of those flakey collections of
dust which gather under furniture that has not been moved
for a long time. By then I had certainly learned to talk,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
for those flakes of dust I called “quacks.” I do not know
where the name came from, nor why I should have disliked
“quacks,” but they affected me with a strange dread, and
here was a whole army of them where I had never seen but
one or two. Some stupid person running after me with
a broom pretended to sweep them over me, and I started
bawling at the top of my voice. Then, for consolation, I
was lifted up to bury my nose in a bowl of violets, and the
colour and sweetness of the flowers took away my trouble.
Probably it was later than this that I first became aware
of a peculiar sensibility to dress—not to underclothing, but
to my outer garments. To be dressed in a new suit of
clothes gave me a curious physical pleasure—a feeling purely
sensual, and that must, I imagine, have been connected
with the dawn of obscure sex instincts. Such things can
be of little interest save to the student of psychology, and
it would be tedious to catalogue them in full, but I have
no doubt myself that if they, and others, had been intelligently
observed, the whole of my future could have been
cast from them. To me, I confess, they throw a disquieting
light upon all human affairs, reviving that sombre figure
of destiny which overshadowed the antique world.</p>

<p>Another and happier instinct which I brought with me
from the unknown was an intense sympathy with animals.
There was not a cat or dog or goat or donkey in the village
that I had not struck up a friendship with. I even carried
this sympathy so far as to insist on feeding daily the ridiculous
stone lions which flanked the doorsteps at Derryaghy
House. I don’t think I ever actually believed that their
morning meal of stale bread gave much pleasure to these
patient beasts, and I had with my own eyes seen sparrows
and thrushes—who very soon came to look out for me—snatch
it from them before my back was turned; still, I
persevered, stroking their smooth backs, kissing their cold
muzzles, just as I lavished depths of affection on a stuffed,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
dilapidated, velvet elephant who for many years was my
nightly bed-fellow.</p>

<p>My only impressions of my mother go back to those days
or, possibly, earlier—a voice singing gay songs to the piano,
while I dropped asleep in my bed upstairs—and then,
again, somebody lifting me out of this bed to kiss me, the
close contact of a face wet with tears, the pressure of arms
that held me clasped tightly, that even hurt a little. That
is all. I cannot remember how she looked, or anything
else. On the evening when she said good-bye to me and
left our house, I knew she was crying, but, though it called
up in me a sort of solemn wonder, I did not understand it,
and went to sleep almost as soon as she put me back into
my bed. It was not till next day that my own tears came,
with the first real sorrow I had known.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>There follows now a sort of blank in my recollections,
which continues on to my ninth or tenth year. I do not
know why this period should have been so unproductive
of lasting impressions. It is like a tranquil water over
which I bend in the hope of seeing some face or vision
ripple to the surface, but my hope is disappointed. Nothing
emerges—not even a memory of any of those ailments,
measles and what not, from which, in common with other
children, I suppose I must have suffered. Nor can I
recollect learning to read. I can remember quite well
when I couldn’t read, for I have a very distinct recollection
of lying on my stomach, on the parlour floor, a book open
in front of me, along whose printed, meaningless lines I
drew my finger, turning page after page till the last was
reached, though what solemn pleasure I could have got
from so dull a game—surely the most tedious ever invented—I
now utterly fail to comprehend.</p>

<p>I was always very fond of being read to, except when
the story had a moral, or was about pious children, when<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
I hated it. The last of these moral tales I listened to was
called “Cassy.” I particularly disliked it, but I can remember
now only one scene, where Cassy comes into an
empty house at night, and discovers a corpse there.
This had an effect on my mind which for several days
made me extremely reluctant to go upstairs by myself after
dark. “Jessica’s First Prayer,” “Vinegar Hill,” “The
Golden Ladder”—how I loathed them all! Every Sunday,
after dinner, my father would take some such volume from
the shelf, open it, and put on his spectacles. Holding the
book at a long distance from his eyes, he would read aloud
in a monotonous, unanimated voice, while I sat on a high-backed
chair and listened, for I was not allowed to play
the most innocent game, nor even to go out for a walk.
These miserable tales were full of the conversions of priggish
children; of harrowing scenes in public-houses or squalid
city dens. Some of them were written to illustrate the
Ten Commandments; others to illustrate the petitions in
the Lord’s Prayer. They contained not the faintest glimmer
of imagination or life: from cover to cover they were
ugly, dull, unintelligent, full of death, poverty and calamity.
On the afternoon when “Cassy’s” successor was produced—I
forget its name—in a state of exasperation, brought
about by mingled boredom and depression, I snatched the
book out of my father’s hands and flung it on the fire. I
was whipped and sent to bed, but anything was better
than “Vinegar Hill,” and next Sunday, also, I refused to
listen. Again, with tingling buttocks, I was banished to
the upper regions, but really I had triumphed, for when
the fateful day came round once more, the book-case was
not opened, and I had never again to listen to one of those
sanctimonious tales.</p>

<p>Fairy stories and animal stories were what I liked best,
while some of the old nursery rhymes and jingles had a
fascination for me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span></p>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“How many miles to Babylon?</div>
    <div class="verse indent3">Three score and ten.</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Can I get there by candlelight?—</div>
    <div class="verse indent3">Yes, and back again.”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="noi">Was it some magical suggestion in the word “candlelight”
that invariably evoked in a small child’s mind a definite
picture of an old fantastic town of towers and turrets, lit
by waving candles, and with windows all ablaze in dark
old houses? Many of these rhymes had this quality of
picture making:</p>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Hey, diddle diddle,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">The cat and the fiddle,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">The cow jumped over the moon:</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">The little dog laughed</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">To see such sport</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">When the dish ran away with the spoon.”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="noi">That, I suppose, is pure nonsense, yet the magic was there.
Before and after the cow made her amazing leap the stuff
was a mere jingle: it was the word “Moon” that brought
up the picture: and I saw the white, docile beast, suddenly
transformed, pricked by the sting of midsummer madness,
with lowered head and curling horns, poised for flight, for
the wonderful upward leap, while a monstrous, glowing
moon hung like a great scarlet Chinese lantern in the clouds,
low against a black night.</p>

<p>At this time I had few books I cared for, but as I grew
older, and my powers of understanding increased, I found
more, for up at Derryaghy House was a whole library in
which I might rummage without any other interference
than that my father could exercise from a distance. Sometimes
when I brought a book home which he did not approve
of, he would send me back with it; but if I had begun it
I always finished it. I had made this a rule; though, on
the other hand, if I had not begun it, I let my father have
his way.</p>

<p>Everything connected with the East had a deep attraction<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
for me—or, shall I say, what I imagined the East to
be—a country of magicians and mysterious talismans, of
crouching Sphinxes and wonderful gardens. I delighted in
the more marvellous stories in the “Arabian Nights,” and
I regretted infinitely that life was really not like that. To
go for a walk and fall straightway on some wonderful
adventure, that was what I should have loved. I remember
poring over a big folio of photographs of Eastern monuments.
Those mystical, winged beasts with human heads,
in their attitude of eternal waiting and listening, touched
some chord in my imagination: they had that strangeness
which I adored, and at the same time they had an odd
familiarity. I appeared to remember—but, oh, so dimly!—having
seen them before, not in pictures, but under a
hot, heavy, languid sun, long, long ago. The luxuriousness,
the softness and sleepy charm of the Asiatic temper—I had
something in common with it, I could understand it. The
melodious singing of a voice through the cool twilight; the
notes of a lute dying slowly into silence; another voice,
low and clear and musical, reading from the “Koran”—where
had I heard all that? I pictured great coloured
bazaars, where grave merchants with long white beards sat
cross-legged and silent, where beautiful, naked, golden-skinned
slaves stood waiting for a purchaser, where you
could buy silken carpets that would carry you over the
world, and black, ebony horses, swifter than light.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Mrs. Carroll had given me one of the upstairs rooms at
Derryaghy to be my very own, and had let me furnish it
myself from a store of old, out-moded furniture, which, for
I know not how long, had been gathering dust and cobwebs
in a kind of immense, low attic called the lumber-room.
Everything was more or less threadbare and worn, but I
had plenty to choose from, and the actual rummaging was
as exciting as an adventure on a desert island. I had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
discovered a quaint little piano, with but two or three
octaves of notes, and most of those silent, save for a twangling
of wires. This I thought must be Prudence Carroll’s
spinet, for it looked exactly like the one in her portrait;
indeed, that had been my principal reason for bringing it
downstairs. With Prudence Carroll I had been in love all
my life, and sometimes, in the dusk, when I struck very
softly one of the cracked treble notes of the spinet, I would
imagine her spirit stealing on tip-toe up behind me to
listen. Another discovery, and perhaps the most exciting,
was of an old davenport, with a secret drawer at the back
of it—not so very secret, perhaps, since I had found it
without looking for it, owing to the weakness of the spring,
and my own energetic dusting. Inside was nothing more
interesting than some old accounts, written on discoloured
paper, but anybody who opened it to-day would, I fancy,
find more appropriate documents....</p>

<p>There was a cushioned window-seat, low and deep, and
from it I could look out over the sea. In summer, with
the window wide open, I could listen to it also, and to all
kinds of lovely songs coming through it, dreamy and happy
and sad. For there was a sort of undercurrent of dreaming
that ran through my life. The romance surrounding the
picture of Prudence Carroll, that peculiar, brooding quality
of mind by which I could give to such things a kind of
spiritual life that had for me an absolute reality, was, perhaps,
only too characteristic of a mental condition which
might unsympathetically be called that of perpetual wool-gathering.
Though I played cricket and football, and
bathed and knocked about generally with the other boys
in the village, I had no close friend, and I dreamed of an
imaginary playmate. For this playmate and myself I invented
appropriate adventures. He had a name, which I
shall not write here, and I still think he was an extraordinarily
nice boy, but he dropped out of my existence about<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
my fifteenth year. I had my secret world, too, where such
adventures took place. Behind this inner, imaginative life
must have lurked a vague dissatisfaction with life as I
actually found it. Now and then I read something which
appeared to me to describe my other world, and, as I
chanced on such suggestions more frequently in verse than
in prose, I became a great reader of poetry. The passages
that echoed so familiarly, though so faintly, from my
mysterious, lovely land, brought it up before me very much
as the scent of a flower may call up a vision of a high-walled
summer garden. Whether any reality lay behind it, I don’t
know that I even asked myself; but, on drowsy summer
afternoons, dream and reality would float and mingle together,
and I would feel intensely happy.</p>

<p>As I write I would give much to be able to live over
again one of those summer afternoons, when the air hung
heavy with the scent of mignonette and roses, and Mrs.
Carroll sat reading or working, while I lay in the grass on
my back at her feet, and the low sound of the sea splashed
through the silence of my sleepy thoughts, and the booming
of a bee was the slumberous soul of June or July heat
turned to music. In those hours my other world was very,
very near.</p>

<p>Afterwards I sometimes wondered if there were a place
where those lived days were laid away, or if their beauty,
happiness and peace, must be quite lost. They had a
quality of peacefulness that for me no later days have had:
I seemed to dip deep into their cleansing dreamy quiet, as
into a clear sea.</p>

<p>Other dreams I had, that were not so pleasant, but they
came only at night. One I still remember vividly was
unfortunately typical of many. I seemed to be walking
down a street with another boy, when our attention was
attracted by the high, bare wall of a house. There was
something, I know not what, about this house, which made<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
it different from its neighbours and aroused our curiosity.
We noticed in the wall, almost on the street level, a small
window. This window was open, and a fatal fascination
drew us to it at once. I watched my friend crawl through,
for we knew the house was empty; then I followed him,
the opening being just wide enough to admit me. Inside,
we found ourselves on a gigantic marble staircase, spiral
in form, and winding up and down as far as we could follow
it with our eyes. There were no windows except the one
we had entered by, and it, somehow, was invisible from
inside, yet the place was perfectly lighted. There were no
landings, no doors, nothing but this staircase, absolutely
uniform in its construction, with low, broad, marble steps
which wound down and down, and up and up. The place
resembled a vast, still well, and we could not hear the
slightest sound as we stood listening. The steps were very
shallow, and we ran lightly down. The other boy went
more quickly than I did, and in a little while I lost sight
of him, though I still heard his footsteps, growing ever
fainter, till at last they died away, and the stillness closed
in about me with a strange heaviness. I continued to
follow him, but all at once I noticed that the stairs I trod
were darker and stained with damp. A faint chill odour
and feeling of damp and decay rose, too, into my face, and
the light was growing dimmer. I knew I was going down
into a great vault or tomb far below the ground, a charnel-house,
an unknown place of death. I caught sight far
below me of a light as of a lamp burning, and I had an
intuition, a consciousness that came to me in a flash, that
my companion had awakened something. This knowledge
brought with it a memory of mysterious horror, a memory
that I had been here before. Then, with an ever increasing
terror, I began to run up the steps I had just run down,
but my feet had grown heavy and my limbs weak. Up
and up I hurried, seeing nothing before me but an endless<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
stretch of winding marble stairs. I did not know where
my window was, I might even now have passed it. I heard
nothing, but I knew I was being followed, and that whatever
it was that followed me was gaining on me rapidly.
I could hardly breathe: an agony of fear shook me. Then
I heard close to my ear the bark of a dog. It was the
window. I dropped on my knees and squeezed my head
and shoulders through; I was almost free when I felt
myself grasped from behind and with a scream I woke,
shaking, panting, bathed in sweat.</p>

<p>There came a time when these nightmares occurred so
frequently that I got to be able to waken myself out of
them. While I was actually dreaming—when I would
have run a few steps down the stair, for example—a sudden
foresight of what was coming would dawn upon me, and
by a violent struggle I would break through the net of
sleep and sit up in bed. Many of these dreams were connected
with a dark, mahogany wardrobe which stood in
my father’s bedroom. When I had begun to dream and
found myself in that room I knew something evil was going
to happen, and I would watch the wardrobe door and
struggle violently to wake myself before it should open.
Even when I was wide awake, and in broad daylight, this
so ordinary piece of furniture came to have, for me, a
sinister aspect. It was odd that I should have suffered
so from these grisly nocturnal terrors, for in ordinary life
I was not in any way a coward. A feeling of shame made
me keep them a profound secret, and as I grew older they
diminished, till by the time I was fifteen they had practically
ceased.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Perhaps I should here attempt some slight description
of my father, whom I have already mentioned, and of my
home. My father was the National schoolmaster at Newcastle,
County Down, and our house was next door to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
school. My bedroom window looked out over the sea,
about a hundred yards away, and behind the house were
the Mourne Mountains, and the Derryaghy estate, which
took in the lower slopes of Slieve Donard. Our house,
when the Virginian creeper that covered it was red, looked
pretty enough from the road, but was poorly and even
meagrely furnished. The most that could be said for it
was that it was clean and tidy. The few attempts at
ornamentation would have been better away—the two or
three pictures, the hideous vases on the mantelpiece. My
father had a strong liking for illuminated texts, and
there were several of these, in gilt frames, in every
room in the house, including the kitchen and the
bath-room. What furniture there was was modern,
cheap, and objectionable: it was characteristic of my
father that he had never even bought himself a comfortable
arm-chair.</p>

<p>He was a tall man, thin and grizzled, pale, and dressed
always in an ill-cut, ready-made, black tail-coat and waistcoat,
with dark gray trousers. I always disliked his clothes,
especially the two shining buttons at the back of his coat.
He wore a beard and moustache, both somewhat ragged,
and his brown eyes were indescribably melancholy. His
hands and feet were very coarse and large. There was
power in his face, but there was a depressing lack of anything
approaching geniality. He gave me the impression
that he did everything from a sense of duty, and nothing
because he took a pleasure in it. The seriousness of his
expression was truly portentous: it was impossible that
anything in the world could matter so much as that. He
was not well-off—that is obvious from the position he
occupied—but he lived in a way that was unnecessarily
economical. He was by no means ungenerous if it were
some case of distress that had come to his knowledge, but
in ordinary life he was excessively near. The only luxuries<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
he had ever permitted himself were these coloured texts,
and they cost little.</p>

<p>When I was with him I never felt quite at my ease, and
this made me sulky and perpetually on the defensive. I
was not more with him than I could help, and as we lived
alone together, with only an old woman who came in every
day to look after the house and do the cooking, it must have
been easy for him to see that I avoided his society. I never
pretended to myself to have any particular affection for
him, and I don’t even know that it would have mended
matters if I had.</p>

<p>One night, when I was about fourteen, I woke up in the
dark, with the consciousness that it was very late and that
I was not alone in my room. The next moment I knew my
father was there, kneeling beside my bed. I lay absolutely
quiet: I knew he was praying, and praying for me. Presently
I heard him sigh, and then rise noiselessly to his feet,
but I gave no sign. I heard him move away, I heard my
door being softly closed, the faint click of the latch as it
slipped into its place. I lay on with my eyes wide open,
wondering why he had come in like this. I did not like it.
It made me feel uncomfortable, as all emotions do when we
are unable to respond to them. I believed my father cared
for me far more than for anything else in the world, yet
somehow that did not help matters. It was not the sort of
love that begets love in return. Though he loved me, I
felt he did not trust me, or rather that he believed I had an
infinite capacity for yielding to temptation. By this time
I understood that when my mother left home she had gone
to somebody else. I knew at any rate that she was living,
for she had sent a sum of money for my education, which my
father had returned, though some scruple of conscience had
made him think it right to tell me he had done so. But he
explained nothing and I asked no questions. As I lay
awake that night I thought of all this, and it occurred to me<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
that it might have much to do with his extraordinary
anxiety about my religious and moral life. He was afraid,
and I lay awake for a long time trying to puzzle out what it
was he was afraid of.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>It was quite impossible for him to make me religious.
For one thing, it was not in my nature. It was not so much
that I disbelieved what I was taught of religion, as that
these instructions aroused in me an implacable antagonism.
I did not like the notion of an all-seeing God, for instance.
Imperfectly grasped, this conception represented to my
mind a kind of tyranny, a kind of espionage, which I strongly
resented. Moreover, I detested Sundays and everything
connected with them. When I went to church it was with
a face like a thunder-cloud, and once there, with an incredible
obstinacy, I would shut my ears to all that went
on, prayers, hymns, and sermon. This fact, combined with
so many others, tended, as time passed, to make my relations
with my father more and more strained, for he was religious
in the narrowest and severest fashion. I remember his
taking me, one Sunday evening, when I was between twelve
and thirteen, to hear a preacher who had come from a
considerable distance to hold two special services. The
occasion stands out from all others, because it was the only
one upon which I was startled out of my habitual attitude
of sulky defiance. For the first three-quarters of an hour
all went as usual, and when the sermon was about to begin I
prepared myself to think of other things. But the text,
or texts, delivered in a quiet, impressive voice, arrested my
attention.</p>

<p>“For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against
kingdom: and great earthquakes shall be in divers places,
and famines, and pestilences; and fearful sights and great
signs shall there be from heaven.... Your sons and your
daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
visions, and your old men shall dream dreams: and I will
show wonders in heaven above, and signs in the earth beneath;
blood and fire, and vapour of smoke: the sun shall
be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood....
And then shall they see the Son of Man coming in a cloud,
with power and great glory.”</p>

<p>In spite of myself the words thrilled me with their vivid,
menacing suggestiveness, and I listened intently to what
followed. It seemed apparent that the end of the world
was at hand. The signs were taken up one by one, and it
was shown, to my growing discomfiture, that all had been
fulfilled: nothing remained but the sounding of the last
trumpet, which, according to the preacher—he seemed even
to regard it as highly probable—might take place that very
night. By the time he had reached this point my disquietude
had become abject fear, and I joined fervently in
the last prayer. But why had I never been told of this
imminent danger? When we got back from church, it was
a very subdued boy who sat by his father’s side, a Bible
open on the parlour table in front of him. I read with a
feverish haste to prove my changed way of life, and, it must
be confessed, also to keep off as long as possible the hour of
bed-time. There was a horrible plausibility about what I
had heard. The concluding words kept ringing in my ears.
“I see no reason why it should not be this very night.”
“Wouldn’t it, in fact, be just the kind of thing that <em>would</em>
happen at night?” I asked myself piteously; and I was
tormented by a dread of the hideous trumpet note, by a
bloody moon, and by the apparition of dead and shrouded
bodies, rising up with glaring eyeballs and tied jaws and all
the mouldering signs of the grave—dreadful, galvanized
corpses, risen from their wormy beds to meet their Lord in
the air. At length I could put off my bed-time no longer.
I could see my father was not convinced by the open Bible,
and, with his usual suspiciousness, had become curious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
as to what passages I was so interested in. Ten minutes
later, on my knees in my small, candle-lit bedroom, I was
lying to my God of a tremendous love I had begun to feel for
Him; but in spite of this I passed an abominable night.
In the morning I continued my miserable hypocrisy, grovelling
before this frightful Deity for Whom I had developed
so sudden and demonstrative an affection, and Whom, at the
same time, I begged naïvely not to come. Gradually, but
not for several days, these terrors faded, receiving their
death-blow when my father told me that all Jews must
return to Jerusalem before the last day. Now there was a
Jewish family living at Castlewellan, whom I thought I
could keep my eye on, and as I had heard nothing of their
moving I felt fairly safe.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Very quickly I became more emancipated as I began to
think things out for myself, and a year later I could laugh
at these early fears. My father told me a crude anecdote
which he had read, I think, in Mark Pattison’s “Memoirs.”
A man in a public-house in Leicestershire had used the oath,
“God strike me blind,” and instantly he had been struck
blind by a flash of lightning. On becoming converted he
had recovered his sight while taking the Sacrament. This
edifying tale was, I believe, vouched for by a friend and
disciple of Cardinal Newman’s, but to me, I confess, it
seemed as stupid and revolting as anything I had ever
heard. My father declared it to be true, yet I secretly
doubted it, and that afternoon, in my own room, standing
by the window, I said aloud, and very deliberately, “God
strike me blind! God strike me blind!” I waited with
a mingled trepidation and incredulity, as if I had thrown
some mysterious bomb into the unknown. A sea-gull flew
past the window, white against the dark autumn sky: the
leaves of the Virginian creeper trembled and grew still. I
said again and in a louder voice, “God strike me blind!”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
But no flash of lightning followed. Down below, on the
beach, the gray waves curled over with a slow musical
splash. I looked into the sky, but it was calm and untroubled,
and I decided that the story was a myth.</p>

<p>Most of my religious difficulties were, however, metaphysical.
The conception of eternity was one I could not
grasp. I could, in a vague way, figure myself as living on
for ever, but I could not with the same facility move my
mind backward. I seemed able to imagine that there might
be no end, but I could not imagine that there had been
no beginning. “If there had been no beginning, how could
we ever have got as far as this?” I asked myself. “Where
I am now—this particular moment—must be at a certain
distance from something, or it cannot be anywhere. But
if there is no beginning, then this moment cannot be any
further on than yesterday was!” My brain grew dizzy
with vain efforts to think impossible thoughts. I would
break a stick and say, “God can make it that I haven’t
broken it. But if I shut my eyes, and when I open them
the stick is whole, that will only show He has mended it.
Yet He is all-powerful!” And so on, and so on; for whatever
point I took up, sooner or later I was met by an
insoluble problem. These problems were, nevertheless, just
what fascinated me. The practical ethics of religion, that
I should simply be good and encourage in myself a variety
of Christian virtues—that kind of thing did not interest me
in the least. As a matter of fact, I possessed singularly
few of these virtues. It is true that I detested any kind
of meanness or cruelty, that I was truthful, straightforward,
and, in certain directions, loving and gentle enough; but
I was egotistical, proud, and ludicrously self-conscious,
quick tempered, flying into violent passions for very little,
and, above all, I had a stubbornness nothing could move.</p>

<p>It is difficult, as I have said, in looking back over those
days, to see things in any fixed order. It is as if one’s
memories floated in a kind of haze, appearing and disappearing,
melting into one another. But there is a definite
point from which my story becomes consecutive, and I can
carry it back as far as that cold, clear January morning,
the morning of Mr. Carroll’s funeral, when I stood beside
my father, at some distance from the grave, among a group
of people I did not know, and whom I should never see
again. I examined them all with a mild and impartial
curiosity, and was struck by the fact that none of them
showed the slightest emotion, though all alike wore a grave
and decorous demeanour. I could not blame them, for I
did not feel sad myself. Mr. Carroll had always been
perfectly amiable to me, but I had seen little of him, and
when we did meet he had looked at me vaguely, as if he
were unable to remember who I was. I had only known
him as an invalid, occasionally hobbling about with the
aid of two black, silver-headed sticks, but for the most part
keeping pretty closely to his own rooms. He seemed to
me to be very old, yet at his death I learned that he was
not old at all, his appearance of decrepitude being simply
the result of an excessively disorderly life, imposed upon a
naturally wretched constitution. I learned, at the same
time, the history of Mrs. Carroll’s marriage; how, before<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
the first year was out, she had ceased to see much of her
husband, and a little later had ceased to see him altogether.
It was fifteen years afterwards, when he had become the
futile person I knew, that he had returned to her. As the
coffin, bared of its covering of sickly-smelling flowers, was
lowered into the ugly, gaping grave, and the damp red
earth rattled heavily on the lid with a hollow, brutal sound,
I recalled the strange, white face, the watery blue eyes,
the fixed smile, the soft, polite manner; but I was not in
the least grieved to know I should never see them again.
And when, a week or so later, I was once more in and out
of the house just as of old, I had already ceased to think
of him. Once or twice, passing the closed door of his room
in the dusk, the thought of meeting his ghost, of hearing
the tap, tap of his stick coming toward me down the long
passage, gave me a momentary thrill; but even these poor
tributes to his memory faded swiftly, passed into a total
oblivion.</p>

<p>Scarlatina broke out in the village in the spring of that
year, a week or two before my sixteenth birthday. There
were not many cases, and all were mild, but there was much
talk of closing the school. My father, for I know not what
reason, was against this, and in the end got his own way,
but about a month later he had the satisfaction of seeing
me catch the infection just when everybody else was getting
better. I can remember quite distinctly the day I took
ill. I had not been feeling well the day before, but had said
nothing about it, and that morning I went to school as usual.
I might as well have stayed at home for all the work I did.
I sat there with a book before me, my head aching, my
throat dry and painful. The noise of the classes saying their
lessons at the tops of their voices, especially the junior class,
to whom Miss McWaters was repeating a stanza of poetry,
line by line, while they screamed it after her, irritated, even
while it amused, me. Miss McWaters was a thin and angular
person, no longer young, endowed by nature with a high-pitched
voice, prominent teeth, and a red nose, and by art
with a yellow, fuzzy fringe. All these qualities now loomed
particularly large in my vision of her, though at other times
I knew she was a kind and friendly person. Her red nose
and her fringe haunted me, her whole face seemed to undergo
extraordinary, kaleidoscopic changes; she became a sort
of fantastic witch who was exercising horrible spells on these
small children standing in a circle round her chair; her
mouth grew larger, her big white teeth seemed thirsting to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
bury themselves in their soft little throats. This impression
grew suddenly so sharp that I had to shake myself and
sit back in my seat to get rid of it. Then once more she was
only Miss McWaters, to whom years ago I had repeated this
same verse of poetry in that same shrill sing-song tone which
now was going through and through my head....</p>

<p>I looked about the room with heavy eyes—at the white
walls, the torn, ink-stained maps, the scored desks and
forms, the wooden floor—and the whole place seemed to
move round and round like a wheel. I saw my father, with
a pointer in his hand, indicating differently shaped areas
on a large blank map of England, and asking a row of
youngsters what counties they represented. That was the
kind of lesson I had always detested myself and had never
even attempted to learn. I knew from my father’s angry,
“Next—next—next,” that nobody in the class was giving
satisfaction. And then they all seemed to shrink and float
back, while the room shot out like a telescope, and I watched
them from somewhere miles and miles away. And the
high, clear voice of Miss McWaters proclaimed:</p>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Our bugles sang truce, for the night-cloud had lower’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent3">And the sentinel stars set their watch in the sky.”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="noi">And a dozen shrill voices replied:</p>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Our bugles sang truce, for the night-cloud had lower’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent3">And the sentinel stars set their watch in the sky.”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="noi">The words seemed mere nonsense in my ears, and I had a
sort of delirious vision of a big star, with a red nose and a
fringe and large white teeth, pointing out the time on a huge
clock, while a lot of little stars stood round in a ring and
pulled watches out of their waistcoat pockets and set them
to the time told by the big clock. This seemed funny to me,
and I began to laugh; and then, next moment, I wanted to
lie down somewhere and be quiet. My head was throbbing
like a steamboat with a too powerful engine, and there was
a dull aching at the back of my eyeballs. I got up and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
tip-toed across the room, but my foot caught the end of a
form, and I nearly pitched through the door, head first.</p>

<p>I had intended going home, but with my hand on the latch
of the gate I decided to go up to Derryaghy instead. Singularly
enough, the thought that I might be sickening for
scarlatina never occurred to me. The distance to Derryaghy
was not more than a quarter of a mile, yet it seemed
to me long, and before I arrived I regretted having started.
The hall-door being open when I reached the house, I went
in without ringing. I knew they would be at lunch, but I
had no appetite, and as I did not want to answer questions
or talk, I went straight on up the broad, low stairs, with
the intention of going to my own room. At the head of the
staircase, full in the light, hangs the celebrated portrait
people come from far to admire. I sat down on the wide couch
before it, not because I wanted to look at what I had already
seen thousands of times, but because my head swam. I
leaned against the back of the couch and closed my eyes.
When I opened them, the portrait being in front of me,
I could not help staring at it, in a dull way. It represents
a young man standing bare-headed on a hill-side, holding
a gun in his hand, and with an elderly dog seated sedately by
him. The curiously long, oval face, with its high forehead
and narrow, pointed chin, has much distinction, though
little beauty, and its pallor contrasts oddly with the faded
red of the full sensuous lips, completely revealed beneath
the light, curled moustache. The eyes are dark, the hair
light brown. The hands are hidden by brown gauntlet
gloves, and over the dark brown doublet falls a lace collar.
The trousers would look black but for the darker shade of
the long boots, and this darker note is carried through to the
trees behind, sombre and heavy against a yellow sky. Both
man and dog are obviously posing for their portraits—the
whole thing is a work of art, that is to say, it is something
utterly beyond nature. The highest light is in the face,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
but there is no white anywhere, and, with the exception of
the faint red of the lips, no colour save the browns and
blacks, the creamy flesh-tints. Over all, the mellow tone
of time has cast a kind of golden softness. I had been told
that it was by a great Spanish artist called Velasquez—his
name, indeed, was there, in large black letters on the dull
gilt frame—and that it was a very valuable painting, worth
fabulous sums. I can affirm to-day that it is really a fine
work; but it is not by Velasquez. It is by Mazo, and is,
in fact, only a slightly modified copy of Velasquez’s famous
portrait of Philip in the Louvre.</p>

<p>This picture had always had an odd fascination for me,
though there was something about the face I did not like,
something cold and proud, which I knew I should have
detested in actual life. I gazed at it now stupidly enough,
and then I had a nervous thrill, for it seemed to me to have
come all at once to life. One part of my brain knew this
to be nonsense, and that I had been seeing queer things all
day, but the other part of my brain continued to watch it,
with a half expectation of seeing it descend out of its frame.
The eyes had begun to move, and the lips trembled; the
mouth opened slowly in a yawn which the brown gloved
hand was raised languidly to conceal; and then from behind
the picture I heard a little mocking laugh. These
things bewildered me, but did not startle me; and through
them I became conscious that Mrs. Carroll was coming up
the stair and that she was speaking to me. I answered her
in words which I knew were perfectly idiotic, and which
moreover sounded husky and strange, as if some other voice
than my own were speaking through my lips. Again I
heard the little mocking laugh. This time I thought it
came from the top of the picture, and glancing up I saw,
sure enough, a black imp, like a small, naked, negro boy,
perched cross-legged, on the top of the frame, from which
he grinned down at me impudently, raising his fingers to his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
snub nose, and spreading them out in a derisive and very
familiar grimace. I began to talk about the picture, about
school, and about Miss McWaters. Then a cloud waved
back from my brain; the portrait slid into its place, the
imp disappeared, and everything was once more as it should
be. But I felt a burning thirst, and when Mrs. Carroll
opened the door of a large, bright, sunny room, I was glad
to fling myself down on the bed. Almost immediately I was
seized by a deadly sickness. I managed to get off the bed in
time to avoid making a mess, but the vomiting returned
again and again, till I collapsed into a state of exhaustion.
Heavy clouds waved across my brain, obscuring my thoughts,
and again clearing, leaving consciousness to flicker up, like
the flame in a dying lamp, so that I knew I had been undressed
and was safe in bed. And all the time I wanted to
drink—to drink.... More than one person was in the room
with me; Mrs. Carroll was there, and old Doctor O’Brian.
In the open doorway Miss Dick hovered. And then suddenly
I was alone. I could hear a fire crackling in the grate,
and it had grown darker. A lamp was burning on a table
somewhere over beside the fireplace. I listened to the fire,
and presently it seemed to me I could hear the lamp burning
too. It burned with a soft low continuous sound that was
like the note of a flute, and it occurred to me that everything
in the world was only sound—the bed I was lying on,
the shadows flickering across the ceiling, the dancing firelight—all
were but notes of a tune. This appeared so
strikingly obvious that I could not understand why I had
never noticed it before. I tried to make out what the tune
was, but it eluded me, flickering away from me like a butterfly.
I turned round in my bed, for I had heard a slight noise
at the door. All seemed now to have grown silent. I
could not hear the lamp burning, nor even the fire. This
silence was surely unusual, abnormal; it filled me with a
vague disquietude. It grew deeper and deeper till I could<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
not hear, even when I strained my ears, the faintest murmur
either without or within the house. The silence was like a
liquid, luminous atmosphere, through which strange things
were floating nearer. It was like a sea, and gradually it
darkened into colour—there was a broad, dark, blue sea
before me, in a strange, rich light, as if I were watching it
through old stained glass. I saw sirens swimming about in
the warm, swelling waves, appearing and disappearing.
They followed a high-pooped, fantastic ship, just as I had
often seen porpoises following a boat out in the bay. The
ship moved along slowly, and its broad, coloured sails were
embroidered with green dragons that shone like fire, and at
its bow was a green, jewelled serpent’s head. Then once
more there was nothing but the room, and I heard a faint
noise as of someone moving in a chair. Another sound
immediately followed, and I started, for it was curiously
different; it was the sound one hears before something
happens. I watched the handle of the door turn, and the
door itself open and close quickly yet stealthily. Three
figures had entered. One was a tall figure in brown, with a
gun in his gloved hand, and he was followed by a great dark
brown dog, who at once leaped on to the bed and sat at the
foot, watching me with sombre, burning eyes. The third
figure was Miss McWaters. Her nose was longer and redder
than I had ever seen it before, and it kept twitching from
side to side in a curious way; her big teeth flashed in an
unpleasant grin, and her fringe waved and curled about as if
it were alive. For the third time I heard the strange little
mocking laugh that had come from behind the picture, but
I could not discover who had uttered it. Perhaps it was
Miss McWaters, for I knew she was waiting for me to say
something—a verse of poetry—yes, I remembered:</p>

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Our bugles sang truce, for the night-cloud had lower’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent3">And the sentinel stars set their watch in the sky.”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="noi">Then a dense, heavy darkness swept up, blotting out
everything.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V</h2>
</div>


<p>I awoke in broad sunlight. The room was full of it, and
the scent of flowers floated in through the open windows
and mingled with the faint smell of drugs. For some time
I lay there quietly, too languid to make a movement or to
speak. Then the door softly opened, and I saw Mrs. Carroll
come in and stand beside my bed. “Is he asleep?” I
heard her ask, for I had closed my eyes. I opened them
and looked up at her.</p>

<p>“No,” I answered, smiling.</p>

<p>She smiled, too. “It’s time for you to take your medicine,”
and the nurse came forward to give it to me. When
I had swallowed it, I lay back among the soft pillows
deliciously....</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The memory of my convalescence is a strange one, for it
came at a time when certain physical changes were taking
place within me, and I seemed to myself to be somehow
different from what I had been before I fell ill. My voice
had altered; my mind was coloured by vague and happy
dreams. Sometimes when I turned in bed or stretched
myself, the contact of the fine linen sheets against my skin
gave me a peculiar thrill, which ran all down my spine.
It appeared I had been very ill, that it had been a touch-and-go
matter whether I should manage to pull through;
yet now I did not feel that I wanted to get well too quickly.
The flowers, the fruit, the brightness, the big delightful<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
room—so different from my room at home—the care everybody
took of me, the books that were read to me, the sense
of being here so securely, with everything just as I liked
it, and with Mrs. Carroll to look after me—all that was
delicious. The one jarring note was my father’s letter,
which I read, and then put back in its envelope. It was
about my escape, how near to death I had been, and how
he hoped the mercy that had been shown me would make
me think seriously. I did not want to think seriously:
I wanted to bask in the sunshine of these pleasant days
while they lasted. If I had died it would have been all
over by this time, and since I hadn’t, why should I be
different? It seemed to me hardly the time to talk of
God’s mercy, seeing that I had barely scraped through a
severe illness. It was like thanking a man, who has just
broken your head with a stick, for not killing you outright.
My father talked of a miracle, but I had slender faith in
miracles, and I regret to say his entire letter struck me as
amazingly unintelligent. In a kind of lazy and sublime
egotism I began to ponder on the oddity of a man like my
father having a son such as I was; and while I was engaged
with these speculations Mrs. Carroll sat beside me, playing
“patience.” She told me my father could not come to see
me for fear of carrying the infection to school, and I received
these tidings with an immense relief, for I had been dreading
that he would want to talk to me about death, and
perhaps make me join in returning thanks for my recovery.
I watched her as she sat there, her plump hands drawing
out the cards, her eyes seriously scanning the faces of those
already turned up. She was a large, placid lady, stout and
ruddy. She must always, even in her earliest youth, have
been plain, but her face was filled with an extraordinary
kindness that made it infinitely pleasant. It was not the
sort of kindness which can be simulated; it was something
that was a natural part of her, and was reflected in all she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
did and said. It had moulded the expression of her countenance,
just as time and weather will alter the features of
a statue. Her eyes were small and gray, and she wore
gold-rimmed spectacles, which, somehow, were becoming
to her. I never saw her dressed in anything but black,
and with a light lace cap on her gray hair. She was extremely
fond of me, and I knew it, and I’m afraid imposed
upon it, though I loved her sincerely. At that time it
appeared to me perfectly natural that she should be fond
of me; it was simply a part of the order of things; it had
always been so, and I couldn’t have imagined anything
else. It never even occurred to me that I had no claim
upon her, except that which she herself had established;
it never occurred to me that I might, in my relation to her,
have been just like any of the other boys in the village.
On the contrary, I looked upon Derryaghy quite as if it
were a second, and certainly much my best-loved, home.</p>

<p>The “patience” failed, and Mrs. Carroll swept up the
cards. “Shall I read to you?” she asked me, and, I
having graciously given my permission, she took up
“Huckleberry Finn.” It was a book I rejoiced in, but I
don’t think Mrs. Carroll cared for it, I don’t think she even
found it funny. She spoke rather slowly, and it amused
me infinitely to hear her gentle voice reproduce the talk of
Huck, or Pap, or the King....</p>

<p>That same day, after lunch, the nurse left. I was getting
on very well, and was to be allowed up toward the end of
the week. In the afternoon Mrs. Carroll had gone out,
and I found myself alone. I went on with “Huck,” but
a chapter or two brought me to the end. I began another
book, “Bevis,” but my eyes grew tired, and I let it drop
on the bed beside me. As I lay idle I was seized by a
desire to get up. I resisted it for a few minutes, and then
I slid into a sitting posture, with my legs hanging over the
side of the bed. It struck me that they had grown absurdly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
thin and long, and I felt wretchedly shaky. I stood up,
all the same, holding on to the bedpost till I got accustomed
to being on my feet, when I put on my dressing-gown, and
walked somewhat uncertainly as far as the door. I turned
the handle and looked out with a strange curiosity into
the passage. It was as if I had been ill for months, it all
somehow seemed so queer and new. The long high corridor,
off which the rooms opened, was hung with tall portraits
that appeared, in the mellow sunlight of high far windows,
to watch me stiffly yet furtively. I liked them, I liked
everything about the place, I liked to look down the passage
with its long row of closed doors, which seemed so mysterious,
reaching right on to the head of the staircase. I
listened for footsteps, but heard nothing. Miss Dick
probably was out, and the servants’ quarters were far
away. I had a feeling that I was really the son of the
house, that everything about it, its pictures, its ghosts,
were mine. I went to my favourite picture and stood
beneath it. It was a portrait of a lady with dark hair and
dark blue eyes, and it was partly this peculiar contrast, I
think, this contrast of blue eyes and black hair, that had
originally pleased me. She was young and she had a
strange quaint name—Prudence Carroll. The artist had
painted her as if she were just come in from the garden,
for she held still a bunch of flowers in her hand. She was
standing by a queer little piano—or was it a spinet?—the
spinet I had now in my room? It was open, and in a
minute or two she would lay down her flowers and play
some air on it, or the accompaniment of some forgotten
ballad. Did the painter intend to show that these were
the things she was fondest of—music and flowers? Poor
Prudence Carroll had been dust these hundred years, the
notes of her spinet were either cracked or dumb, and her
tardy lover had arrived a century too late, for she had
died unmarried, and but a year after this portrait was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
painted! Why had no one cared for her? Perhaps some
day, between twilight and dusk, she would slip into my
room and sing to me, “Rose softly Blooming,” or “Voi
che sapete!” A rustle of muslin, a ghostly scent of
ghostly flowers, the twangling notes of the spinet, and a
voice singing a song that would sound thin and far off, like
the sound of wind—that is how it would happen.</p>

<p>I was charmed with these fancies, but I stood there only
a few minutes, for there was something odd in that silence
of closed doors and listening portraits, and I returned to
the sunshine of my room. I went to the window and
leaned my forehead against the pane and looked out. Far
away I could see a stretch of sand, streaked with streams
and pools of water, for the tide was out: and beyond the
sand, clear in the sunlight, was the sea, blue-green under
the soft blue sky, marked with indigo and purple where
the bottom was formed of rocks and seaweed. At the
water’s edge some children—from this distance I could
not make out who they were—were sailing toy boats.
With trousers and petticoats well rolled up from bare brown
legs, with their scarlet jerseys and caps and striped cotton
dresses, they formed a bright note of colour, and brought
me into touch again with life out of doors. On the left
horn of the bay’s crescent the sand-hills, with their sparse
covering of bleached, wan grass, were pale and iridescent
in the sun.</p>

<p>A gardener was mowing the grass just below my window,
and the sleepy sound of the mowing-machine was delightful,
and the smell of the fresh green grass, turned over in bright
cool heaps. I got back into bed again, and took up “Bevis.”</p>

<p>I read for half an hour, when my eyes once more grew
tired. The sound of the mowing-machine had ceased, and
a deep silence filled the afternoon. I lay listening to the
silence, half-asleep, half-awake, when all at once I heard
a sound of scraping under my window. It flashed across<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
my mind that I was alone here in this part of the house,
and that burglars were taking the opportunity to break in,
and perhaps they would murder me. The thing was
utterly nonsensical, and would never have occurred to me
had I been in my normal health, but it had hardly entered
my head when I saw a ladder shoot up past the window,
and strike with a grating sound against the wall. My
heart began to thump. I heard steps on the ladder;
somebody was mounting it. The next moment Jim’s face,
brown and ruddy and grinning, popped in, and I gasped
with relief. Jim was a boy who worked in the garden,
and was about the same age as I was. He smiled broadly,
and his bright, brown eyes gazed at me with evident
pleasure. “How are you, Master Peter?” he grinned.
“They’re nobody about, so I thought I’d look in.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m all right,” I answered, “but you mustn’t stay
there, or you’ll be catching the infection.”</p>

<p>“I wanted to see the skin peeling off you. What like
is it underneath?”</p>

<p>I felt disappointed at this callous explanation of what
I had imagined to be sympathy. “You can’t see it,” I
answered crossly. “You’d better clear out before somebody
catches you.”</p>

<p>Jim disappeared, but I called after him, “I say ...
Jim——”</p>

<p>The round, ruddy-brown face bobbed up again.</p>

<p>“Will you do something for me?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Ay.”</p>

<p>“Will you play something to me. I’m sick of lying
here, doing nothing.”</p>

<p>“I darn’t. Oul Thomas’d stop me, an’ I’d get in a row.
I be to red up all the grass, an’ rake the walk.”</p>

<p>“All right.”</p>

<p>I took no further interest in Jim, and he again vanished.
There was a further scraping noise, and the ladder, too,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
disappeared. I lay on in a kind of waking-slumber till Mrs.
Carroll came in, bringing me my tea. When I had finished
I once more fell into a doze, but opened my eyes in the dusk,
when I heard the notes of Jim’s flute under my window, in
a slow melancholy tune, with an occasional pause, as if the
musician was not very certain of his music. I recognised
the air—the Lorelei. It had a curious effect in the gathering
twilight, as if the music and the fading light were in some
subtle way mingled. I knew that the unseen musician was
Jim, yet none the less the mournful notes, coming slowly
in a minor key, seemed the very soul of the deepening darkness,
and called up before me a world of imaginary sorrows,
a passionate regret for I knew not what, a kind of home-sickness
for my dream-land. Tears gathered in my eyes
and ran down my cheeks. Fortunately nobody could see
them, but I was ashamed of them myself, though I knew
they were partly the result of my physical weakness. Still,
it was ridiculous that I should cry over Jim’s playing. Jim
really couldn’t play at all. It was stupid, idiotic; and the
other day I had cried just in this same senseless fashion over
a book I had been reading; I had wept my soul out in an
ecstasy of love and misery.</p>

<p>When Jim’s serenade was ended I lay on in the darkness,
my tears drying on my cheeks, and thought what a fool I
was. Why should I have cried? What was the matter
with me? It was not that I was unhappy; on the contrary,
I was extremely happy. Yet somehow I felt dimly
that there was a greater happiness than any I had ever
experienced or probably ever should experience. The
meaning of my emotions and desires never became quite
clear, though I seemed on the verge of discovery. It was
as if there were something stirring within me to which I
could not give freedom, something which remained
unsatisfied even in the midst of my keenest pleasures....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span></p>

<p>On a bright morning early in June I was allowed out for
the first time since my illness, and I insisted on going alone.
As I came out into the warmth of the sun I felt a charm as
of a mysterious new birth. I went straight to the woods.
The green alleys winding in front of me amid tall old trees,
in all the vivid richness of early summer, seemed exquisitely
beautiful. It was as if I had never realized before how
lovely the world was. I lay down on my back on the warm,
dry moss and listened to a skylark singing as it mounted up
from the fields near the sea into the dark clear sky. No
other music ever gave me the same pleasure as that passionately
joyous singing. It was a kind of leaping, exultant
ecstasy, a bright, flame-like sound, rejoicing in itself. And
then a curious experience befell me. It was as if everything
that had seemed to me external and around me were suddenly
within me. The whole world seemed to be within me.
It was within me that the trees waved their green branches,
it was within me that the skylark was singing, it was within
me that the hot sun shone, and that the shade was cool. A
cloud rose in the sky, and passed in a light shower that
pattered on the leaves, and I felt its freshness dropping into
my soul, and I felt in all my being the delicious fragrance
of the earth and the grass and the plants and the rich brown
soil. I could have sobbed with joy, but in the midst of it I
heard the sound of footsteps, and looked behind me quickly,
to see the figure of one of the two idiots, who lived in a hovel
outside the village, approaching. This was the man;
there was a woman also, his sister. He was perfectly harmless,
and he drew near now with smiles meant to be ingratiating.
He held an empty pipe in his hand, and made
guttural noises that I knew were asking me for tobacco. I
told him I had none, but he would not go away. He stood
right over me, a grin on his deformed face. The big, misshapen
head, the horrible, slobbering mouth, the stupid
persistence, all filled me with a cold rage. He had spoiled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
everything; I hated him, and I could have killed him, for it.
But he still stood there and jibbered with his ugly, dripping
mouth. It was only when I struck at him savagely with
my stick that he moved off, glancing back at every step.
And when he was gone I felt nothing but a kind of cold
disgust and animosity, mingled with shame at my own
conduct. All the beauty had gone out of the woods, and I
got up and went home.</p>

</div>


<p>When, some time in July, Mrs. Carroll told me that she
had invited her nephew and niece, Gerald and Katherine
Dale, to come on a visit to Derryaghy, I became at once
very curious to see them. I had never even heard of
them before, and now I learned such interesting items as
that they lived in London, were twins, and about my own
age, or perhaps a year older, Mrs. Carroll could not remember.
They arrived at the end of the month, and that night
I went to dinner to meet them. As it happened, I was
late. My watch had stopped for half an hour or so in the
afternoon, and then gone on again, an annoying and foolish
trick it occasionally played me. I was told they were
already in the dining-room, but that dinner had only begun.
The prospect of meeting strangers always produced in me
an unconquerable shyness, and, to-night, partly because I
was late, and partly because these particular strangers
were so nearly my own age, my shyness was doubled. I
did not look at either of them as I entered the room where,
though daylight had not yet quite failed, two softly shaded
lamps burned, amid a profusion of flowers, upon the white
and silver table. I shook hands with my hostess and
with Miss Dick, mumbling out apologies, and had begun
a lengthy and involved description of the cause of my
delay, when Mrs. Carroll cut me short by introducing me
to the Dales. I shook hands with one and bowed to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
other, blushing and incapable of finding a word. I should
never have guessed they were even brother and sister, let
alone twins, for in appearance they were utterly unlike.
Katherine pleased me. She was fresh and bright and
attractive; I even thought her beautiful, for there was
something of the open air about her, something of nature.
At any rate she gave me that impression; her beauty had
a kind of grave simplicity; and, if I had been a poet, and
had been describing her, all my similes would have been
taken from nature, from open hill-sides, from the wind and
the sky. As I sat down beside her, her clear, dark, very
blue eyes rested on me frankly, and with that she suddenly
set me puzzling over where I had seen her before, or whom
she reminded me of. I kept glancing at her furtively,
but, seen in profile, her face was no longer suggestive, and
I decided I had made a mistake. She appeared to me
friendly and candid and unaffected, but I doubted if she
were clever. Her brother, on the other hand, probably
<em>was</em> clever. I did not take to him, he was smaller than
she, thin and brown and subtle; also he had a way of
looking at you that made you want to ask him what it
was he found amusing.</p>

<p>“Peter will be able to show you everything, and take
you everywhere,” Mrs. Carroll explained, comprehensively,
and then Katherine asked me if I played golf.</p>

<p>I answered, “No,” and felt ashamed. I went on to
prove that it was not my fault, that my father had refused
to allow me to join the club, but at that point I caught
Gerald’s eyes watching me with an expression of interest,
and I suddenly blushed. “Do <em>you</em> play?” I asked him
aggressively.</p>

<p>He seemed surprised. His glance just brushed mine
and rested on a picture above my head. “No,” he answered
quietly.</p>

<p>“Gerald is studying music abroad,” said Mrs. Carroll,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
“at Vienna, where I don’t suppose they have ever heard
of golf. He is going to be a musician.”</p>

<p>“How interesting!” exclaimed Miss Dick. “Fancy,
Vienna!”</p>

<p>Miss Dick was Mrs. Carroll’s companion, and was even,
in some distant way, related to her. Her family, however,
had fallen on evil days, and she was permanently settled
at Derryaghy. She was a gushing, fussy, kindly creature,
with a minimum allowance of brains, but overflowing with
good intentions and amazingly loyal in her affections,
though these latter, I must add, had never been bestowed
upon me. I took Mrs. Carroll’s word for it that she had
once been very pretty, but now her thinness, accentuating
a peculiar type of feature, gave her an absurd resemblance
to a lean and restless fowl. I noticed that she had attired
herself to-night as for a striking festival. She was a person
liable to these unexpected changes in the degree of her
brilliancy, which at present was positively dazzling. She
began to ask about Vienna, and expressed a deep regret
at never having visited that city.</p>

<p>“We have had the piano specially tuned for you,” said
Mrs. Carroll to Gerald.</p>

<p>“Oh you shouldn’t have bothered,” he answered.</p>

<p>“You evidently don’t know what it was like before!”
I began, and then stopped short. Nobody took any notice.</p>

<p>Miss Dick, who seemed determined, cost what it might,
to keep the conversation on the subject of music, mentioned
that her mother had heard Patti in “La Sonnambula,” and
how, when that great prima donna had paused in the middle
of the opera to sing “Home Sweet Home,” the entire house
had risen to its feet with enthusiasm. “It has always
seemed to me that music is the most perfect of the arts,”
she added, fixing her lace collar.</p>

<p>“Painting is the most perfect of the arts,” I contradicted.
Somehow, when they were uttered, all my remarks<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
sounded unhappy, not to say rude, though I was only
trying to be agreeable. Miss Dick accentuated this last
one by helping herself to potatoes in significant silence.
“You can look at a picture oftener than you can read a
book,” I went on, addressing Gerald, “and oftener than
you can listen to a piece of music.”</p>

<p>“I daresay,” he answered, and I resented his politeness.
“Why can’t he stand up for his own business?” I thought.</p>

<p>I glanced at Katherine, and wanted to say something
pleasant to her, but that was apparently beyond my power.
My solitary “No,” in answer to her question about golf,
had been the one word I had so far addressed to her. I
relapsed into silence and did not speak again till dinner was
over.</p>

<p>When we went to the drawing-room it looked as if we
were going to have a musical evening, for Miss Dick sat down
at the piano with all the air of a person opening a concert.
She played an arrangement of something or other, by Thalberg.
All Miss Dick’s pieces were arrangements, except
those that were fantasias, and it was a feature of them that
the beginning of the end could be heard about a couple of
pages off, in a series of frantic rushes and arpeggios. She
played now with a fierce concentration on the task to be
accomplished; her face getting redder as Thalberg became
more surprising; her mouth screwed up slightly at the right
corner, through which just the tip of her tongue was visible;
her eyes glaring, devouring the sheet of music before her,
at which every now and then she made a frantic grab with
her left hand, to turn the page—she would never allow anybody
to turn for her.</p>

<p>When she had struck the last note, to which she indeed
gave an astonishing rap, there was a general sigh, as for a
danger evaded.</p>

<p>“My dear, I don’t know how you do it!” Mrs. Carroll
murmured, almost as breathless as the performer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span></p>

<p>“It does take it out of one,” Miss Dick panted complacently.</p>

<p>Gerald sat looking on with a barely perceptible smile.
“Won’t you play something now?” Miss Dick said to him.</p>

<p>His eyebrows twitched slightly. “Not just yet, I think.
In a little. I want to smoke a cigarette first.” He passed
out on to the terrace, and we all gazed after him. When
he thought, I suppose, that the echoes awakened by Miss
Dick had had time to subside, he came back, and began to
fiddle with the music-stool, screwing it up and down. Yet
when he did commence to play, after many preliminaries, it
was in a broken fragmentary fashion, beginning things and
suddenly dropping them after a few bars. I was prepared
not to like him, but he had not struck more than a note or
two when I knew I had never heard the piano really played
before. In spite of myself I felt the dislike I had conceived
for him slipping away, and then, just as I was commencing
to enjoy myself, he stopped abruptly. He got up and walked
over to the window where I sat.</p>

<p>“You haven’t altered, Gerald,” said Mrs. Carroll dryly.</p>

<p>“Do you mean my playing, Aunt?” he asked sweetly.
“It is supposed to have got rather better, but I am sure you
are right.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Carroll gave something as nearly resembling a sniff as
she could give. I saw she was not in love with her nephew;
but Miss Dick’s cat jumped on to his knee and he began to
stroke it. There was something in his extreme self-possession
which, though I knew it to be based on a profound sense
of superiority to everybody present, I could not help admiring,
just as I could not help admiring his playing, or, for
that matter, his personal beauty, which was striking. And
I admired the way he was dressed. While remaining quite
conventional, it managed to suggest individuality, and its
perfect taste, apparent in the slightest details, gave him, as
he sat there, something of the finish, of the harmony and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
tone, of an old portrait. Again his glance met mine. I
believe he knew I had been watching him, and perhaps something
of what I had been thinking, and I turned away
abruptly. Miss Dick, who had taken a great fancy to him,
begged him to play again. He refused, yet a moment later
he said, speaking so that nobody but I could hear him,
“Would you like me to?”</p>

<p>“Not in the least,” I answered rudely. Rather ashamed
of myself I got up, crossed the room, and boldly took possession
of a chair beside his sister. But with that my boldness
ended, and I could think of nothing to say. I had not even
sufficient courage to look her in the face, and the fact that I
had so deliberately come to sit beside her only to maintain a
fixed and gloomy silence made me feel ridiculous.</p>

<p>“Do you play golf?” I stammered out at last, the inanity
of my remark only striking me after it had left my lips.
“She will think I am a fool, and dislike me,” I told myself
miserably; but Katherine answered as if the subject had
never been alluded to before. Her reply only left me to
rack my brains anew. It was no use; a malignant spell
appeared to have been cast upon me, holding me tongue-tied,
my mind a blank. A perspiration broke out all over
my body and I could feel my shirt sticking to my back.
Every minute was like an hour, yet I could think of nothing
but this accursed golf. I described the links and even the
Club House, and might have gone on to enumerate the
caddies had I remembered their names. I became suddenly
conscious that my hands and feet were enormous. I
thrust my hands in my trouser pockets, but my feet still
remained visible. I knew my thick nose had neither shape
nor character, that my coarse, brown hair was more like a
kind of tropical plant than like hair, and that my overhanging
brows and the shape of my mouth gave me a sullen
look. I had tried to alter my appearance by doing my hair
in different ways, but it was no use. I remembered having<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
noticed in the morning, when I was tying my tie, that a slight
frown made me more thoughtful looking, and I instantly
assumed one. I compared the appearance I imagined myself
to present with Gerald’s, and then I saw him watching me
with what I believed to be a kind of veiled mockery in his
eyes. My shyness turned to rage. Katherine tried to talk
to me, but I answered in monosyllables, and, an hour earlier
than I had intended, I got up to say good-night.</p>

<p>“We shall see you to-morrow, Peter,” Mrs. Carroll suggested,
as I shook hands with her. “What would you like
to do to-morrow?” she added, turning to Katherine.</p>

<p>Katherine smiled at me as if we were quite old friends.
“I want to climb some of the mountains,” she said. “I
planned that the minute I saw them.”</p>

<p>Again her face awakened in me the memory of another
face I had known—but where? when?</p>

<p>“In that case you ought to start early,” Mrs. Carroll went
on, “and you could take your lunch with you. Peter
knows all the different walks for miles round.”</p>

<p>I was on the point of declaring that I had an engagement,
but I overcame the temptation. I promised to come soon
after breakfast, and made my escape.</p>

</div>


<p>I went home in a state of profound depression. I had
made a hopeless fool of myself; probably they were talking
about it now. These thoughts were rendered no brighter
by being mingled with anticipations of what I was returning
to. Above all else in the world, perhaps, I hated, and
almost feared, that atmosphere of dullness and joylessness,
which hung like a mist over our house. It exasperated
me, it seemed to sap my vitality, and with all the strength
of my nature I tried to resist it. It was as if the narrowness
and dinginess, the gray, colourless, melancholy monotony
of my father’s existence, had a hateful power of penetrating
into my brain, like the fumes of a drug, clouding my mind,
subduing it to a kind of cold lethargy: there were times
when I had a feeling that I was struggling for life.</p>

<p>My father was in the parlour when I came in. He
glanced up at the clock, which meant that he was surprised
at my returning so much earlier than usual, but he made
no remark. I sat down to take off my boots; then I took
up the book I was reading. My father all this time had
not spoken a word, and I had returned him silence for
silence. Sometimes, after a whole evening of this kind
of thing, my feeling of constraint would become so acute
that the effort required to say even good-night would
appear almost insurmountable, and I would invent all
sorts of excuses for slipping out of the room without<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
doing so. My father was correcting exercises. The books
were arranged in two piles in front of him—those he had
already finished with, and those he had not yet touched.
Behind him was the wall, with its cheap, ugly, flowered
paper, and illuminated texts. I glanced at him from time
to time over the top of my book. There was a perpetual
dinginess in his appearance; his linen was not often scrupulously
clean, and his nails never were. Just now I wanted
to ask him to stop snuffing. How could I read while he
kept on making such disgusting noises! He had a peculiar
way of breathing through his nose so as to produce a sort
of whistling sound, which I could never get accustomed to.
Often I had gone upstairs and sat in an ice-cold bedroom
merely to be rid of it.</p>

<p>Suddenly he looked up over his spectacles and addressed
me across the table. “I intended to ask you about that
book you have brought home. Who gave it to you?”</p>

<p>I at once assumed an air of elaborate nonchalance.
“Nobody gave it to me. I found it in the book-case.”</p>

<p>“What are you reading in it?”</p>

<p>“‘Venus and Adonis.’”</p>

<p>“I don’t like the books you have been reading lately.”</p>

<p>“But this is Shakespeare!” I exclaimed, feigning
tremendous astonishment.</p>

<p>“I don’t care who it is. Why can’t you read what
other boys read?”</p>

<p>“I thought he was supposed to be the greatest poet in
the world!”</p>

<p>“You know very well what I mean. If you <em>do</em> read him,
why don’t you read the plays—‘Julius Cæsar?’”</p>

<p>“I’d rather have poems than plays. What is the harm
in this?”</p>

<p>“The harm is that it is not suited to your age. It is
full of all kinds of voluptuous images and thoughts. You
have been too much at Derryaghy lately.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span></p>

<p>The train of reasoning which connected voluptuous
thoughts with Derryaghy was difficult to follow, yet I was
not surprised that my father had come out there. With
him all roads led to Derryaghy, and I could never understand
what he really felt about my position in relation to
Mrs. Carroll. When he spoke face to face with her his
manner always expressed something like a carefully repressed
disapproval, and at the same time he allowed me
to remain under countless obligations to her. For example,
she looked after, that is to say, she paid for, my clothing.
Also it had been settled recently that she was to pay my
school, and later my university, expenses. I believe a
struggle was perpetually going on within him between his
consciousness of my interests and a desire to tell her to
mind her own business and to leave him to look after his
son himself. This peculiar combination of natural antipathy,
a fear to give offence, and a sense that it was his
duty to be thankful, was singularly ill adapted to produce
a graceful attitude in his personal dealings with her, and
I do not think she cared for him.</p>

<p>“Now that Mrs. Carroll has her nephew and niece, there is
no need for you to go there so often,” he went on. “I was
glad to see that you did not stay late to-night.” He added
the last words in a conciliatory tone, even with approval.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you like her?” I asked simply.</p>

<p>He fixed his eyes sternly upon me. “Why don’t I like
whom?”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Carroll.”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Carroll! I don’t think I understand you!”</p>

<p>As I gave no further explanation he returned to his
exercises, but I could see an irrepressible desire to justify
himself working in his mind. It broke out in another
minute. “You don’t appear to realise that your question
accuses me of both ingratitude and hypocrisy! Or, possibly,
that is what you intended to do?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span></p>

<p>Oh, how well I knew this mood, and how we would go
round and round the same little circle, and how he would
outwardly be so calm and reasonable and not in the least
annoyed, yet inwardly be perfectly furious. “I think I’ll
go to bed,” I murmured, getting up, and pretending to
yawn.</p>

<p>My yawn was only meant to convey sleepiness, but my
father saw in it impertinence. “Why do you try to vex
me?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I don’t try to vex you. Why should I?”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Carroll is different from us. Her position in life
is different; it alters her view of everything; it is only
natural that she should be more worldly.”</p>

<p>“Is she very worldly?” I asked, without enthusiasm.
Anybody less so, I could hardly imagine, but there was no
use arguing.</p>

<p>My father branched off in another direction. “To-night,
at dinner, were you offered wine?”</p>

<p>“I had some claret.”</p>

<p>“You remembered I had told you I would rather you
didn’t take anything?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Are you speaking the truth, Peter?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know whether I remembered or not,” I answered
petulantly. “I didn’t think it important enough to make
a fuss about. You always want me to do everything differently
from other people. If I can’t do as other people do,
I’d rather not go at all.”</p>

<p>“I’m not aware that I told you anything except what
would please me,” he answered coldly. “I left you perfectly
free.”</p>

<p>“How can you call it ‘leaving me free’ when you’re for
ever asking me whether I’ve done it? You say you don’t
forbid me to do things, but you always talk about them
afterwards.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span></p>

<p>There was a pause. It was broken by my father who
seemed now deeply offended. “Did you make any arrangement
about going back?”</p>

<p>“I promised to go to-morrow, after breakfast.”</p>

<p>“What for?”</p>

<p>“I was asked to take the Dales somewhere.”</p>

<p>“Can’t they find their own way? It isn’t very difficult.”</p>

<p>“Does that mean I’m not to go?”</p>

<p>“You can’t be always going there. You seem to me to
live there.”</p>

<p>“It’s easier than living at home,” I muttered.</p>

<p>“It is pleasanter, I daresay; but I don’t want you to
make yourself a nuisance to strangers.”</p>

<p>“Aren’t they the best judges of whether I’m a nuisance or
not?”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t wish you to go to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“You might have said so sooner,” I burst out. “What
reason have you?”</p>

<p>“I hope you don’t intend to be as disrespectful as you
are,” my father said slowly. “If I had no other reason for
not wanting you to go, I should have a very good one in the
way it seems to make you behave when you come back.
I <em>have</em> another reason, however: I don’t desire you to grow
up with an idea that you have nothing to think of in life but
your own pleasures. You are quite sufficiently inclined
that way as it is.”</p>

<p>He spoke quietly, but there was a concentrated feeling
behind his words. “What have I been doing?” I asked,
trying to be equally calm, though I knew my eyes were
bright, my cheeks flushed, and my lips pouting.</p>

<p>“I wasn’t alluding to anything particular so much as to
your whole way of looking at things. You appear to wish
to be absolutely independent, to go out and in just as you
please. You appear to think you have no duty to me or to
anybody else. You are becoming utterly selfish.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span></p>

<p>“Selfish!” I was too indignant to protest more than by
simply repeating the word. People always called you
selfish, I thought, bitterly, when you only wanted to prevent
<em>them</em> from being so. I was convinced I was capable of
making the most sublime sacrifices, if there were any need
for them. Indeed I had often imagined myself making such
sacrifices, making them secretly, but to be discovered in the
end, when all my unsuspected nobility would suddenly be
revealed, in some rather public way, perhaps, but too late
to save those who had wilfully misunderstood me from
agonies of remorse. It was my father who was selfish, with
his idea of making everybody think and act exactly as he
did. He was not only selfish, but he was jealous. That
was at the back of all these objections to my going to
Derryaghy. Only, he never realized his own faults; he
found moral justifications for them. One thing was certain,
I was going there to-morrow, whether he allowed me to or not.
I was so full of these thoughts that I missed a great deal of
what he was saying, but the gist of it I gathered—and I
had heard it frequently before—that I should have my living
to earn, my way to make in the world, that I shouldn’t have
Mrs. Carroll always, and that the fewer luxurious tastes I
acquired, the more chance I should have of being happy in
the very obscure and humble path that was apparently all
my father saw before me.</p>

<p>If he really wanted to inspire me with feelings of humility,
however, he could hardly have wasted his breath on a more
thankless task. It was not that I saw myself becoming remarkably
successful, but simply that I seemed to have had
a glimpse of what an extraordinary youth I was. My interview
with my father had made me forget all about my unhappy
behaviour at Derryaghy, and as soon as I was in bed
I began to compose a passionate drama, of which I was,
naturally, the hero, but in which, without any rehearsal,
Katherine Dale appeared as heroine. I had braved my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
father’s anger in order to be with her, and now I was no
longer shy, the right words rushed from me in a torrent.
Sometimes our love story was happy, more often it was a
perfect bath of tears. Indeed, I think I must have had
some inborn feeling for the stage, so frequently did I lead up
to the most telling and lime-lit situations, on the very weakest
of which a curtain could only go down to a thunder of
applause. In this present drama there was a fathomless
well of sentiment, of “love interest” of the most uncompromising
type. I had read lately, in bound volumes of
<cite>Temple Bar</cite>, one or two novels by Miss Rhoda Broughton,
and as I lay there in my small room, with a text above my
head, I was far from anxious to “keep innocency.” On the
contrary, I was one of those bold, dark, rugged, cynical
creatures, one of those splendid ugly men, who carry in their
breasts a smouldering fire of passion for some girl “with eyes
like a shot partridge”; one of those men who gnaw the ends
of their moustaches, and have behind them the remembrance
of a fearful life. My name was Dare Stamer, or Paul Le
Mesurier, and my heart was sombre and volcanic. The plot
of our romance did not vary a great deal. We met; we
loved; we quarrelled. I married somebody else—a cold,
soulless, blonde beauty with magnificent shoulders—and
Katherine sometimes went into a consumption, and sometimes
did not, but in either case there was a last meeting
between us, when the veils of falsehoods were torn aside,
and for one wild, mad, delirious moment I held her in my
arms, my lips pressed on hers. It was these wild, mad,
delirious moments that so appealed to me. They followed
one another thick and fast as rain-drops in a thunder-shower.
I was ever at a climax. The room was brimmed
up with lovers’ tears and lovers’ kisses, meetings and partings,
yet never perhaps had the text above my head, though
I was far from thinking so, been obeyed so literally and so
successfully.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII</h2>
</div>


<p>I was wakened in the morning by Tony scratching at my
door. Still half-asleep, I got up to let him in, and then
returned to bed, where he had already taken the most comfortable
place. He looked at me for a moment or two and
then closed his round, dark, innocent eyes till they showed
only as two slits of dim silver, and set up a loud snoring. I
was too lazy to get up, and lay idly watching him. He had
a curious and expressive beauty, resembling that of some
wonderful piece of Chinese porcelain, at once bizarre and
attractive. There was something quaint about him, an
adorable simplicity. In colour he was white, decorated
with brindle patches. Leonardo would have made a drawing
of him, would have delighted in the superb limbs and
wide deep chest, the big, broad, heavy, wrinkled head, with
its massive, low-hanging jaw, its upturned, flat, black nose,
its silky ears, like the petals of a rose, and those dark, lovely
eyes, in which, when he was at rest, a profound melancholy
floated. As a pup, able to walk and no more, he had been
a birthday present from Mrs. Carroll: now he weighed
about sixty pounds and was three years old.</p>

<p>As I watched him I tried to make up my mind whether
I should say anything further about going to Derryaghy.
In spite of all last night’s bravery I knew well enough that,
when it came to the point, it was really rather impossible
deliberately to disobey my father; and, what is more, that I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
shouldn’t want to do so. I somehow kept seeing the thing
from his point of view, and this irritated me, because it made
me powerless to do anything but sit at home and sulk.</p>

<p>“I’ll have to go up to the house and say that I can’t
come,” I told him after breakfast. He had risen from the
table and was in the act of taking down our Bibles from the
book-shelf, preparatory to “worship”—a function which
took place every morning and evening, and which consisted
in my reading aloud a chapter from the Bible, and in my
father making a prayer. Sometimes he commented on
what I read, explained a verse, drew a lesson from it—interruptions
I secretly resented, as they tended to prolong
“worship”—sometimes he listened in silence.</p>

<p>He put my Bible down beside my tea-cup before replying.
Then, when he had resumed his seat, and fumbled with his
spectacle-case, he said, “You may go with them: I have
been thinking it over.”</p>

<p>I answered nothing, though I had a sort of uncomfortable
feeling that thanks might possibly be expected. I wondered
what would happen if I were to say I didn’t want to go, that
I should never go again, that I would rather stay here with
him quite alone, free from all “worldly temptations.” It
was really the most perfect opportunity imaginable for a
thoroughly sentimental scene, like those in the stories he
used to read to me. I pictured how it would be wrung out
to the last drop of sloppiness, and be promptly followed by
my conversion, or even death-bed.</p>

<p>“I think it is the ninth chapter of Isaiah,” my father said,
interrupting these meditations.</p>

<p>“I read the ninth yesterday,” I replied. “It’s the tenth.”</p>

<p>My father turned another page, and I began:</p>

<p>“‘Woe unto them that decree unrighteous decrees—’”
I felt my cheeks grow red, because the verse seemed to me
so extraordinarily apt to the decree about my not going to
Derryaghy. I did not look at my father, but keeping my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
eyes glued to the page went on. The rest of the chapter,
however, was less pertinent.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“‘He is come to Aiath, he is passed to Migron; at
Michmash he hath laid up his carriages:</p>

<p>‘They are gone over the passage: they have taken up their
lodging at Geba; Ramah is afraid; Gibeah of Saul is fled.</p>

<p>‘Lift up thy voice, O daughter of Gallim; cause it to be
heard unto Laish, O poor Anathoth.</p>

<p>‘Madmenah is removed; the inhabitants of Gebim gather
themselves to flee,’” etc., etc.</p>
</div>

<p>It was not wildly exciting in itself, and I cannot say my
reading of it made it more so. The only good point about
it was that it did not lend itself to exegesis. The kind of
thing my father liked was, “Servants, be obedient to them
that are your masters.” Then he would interrupt me to
say, “That means, when their masters tell them to do what
is right. If we are told to do something we know to be
wrong, we must refuse to obey.”</p>

<p>When I had finished we knelt down before our chairs.
My father prayed aloud, and I stared out of the window,
and tried to decide whither I should take the Dales. Between
the sentences my father, as usual, kept crossing and uncrossing
his feet, and scraping them together, as if he were
trying to remove a tight pair of slippers. It seemed odd to
me that he could pray so earnestly and at the same time
use such artificial language, crammed with “thees” and
“thous,” and “hearests” and “doests.” Before he had
reached “Amen” I was on my feet, dusting the knees of my
trousers.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX</h2>
</div>


<p>A quarter of an hour later, as I walked up to Derryaghy,
Willie Breen, the grocer’s son, a little boy of ten or eleven,
ran out from the shop, and, after gazing carefully up and
down the road, slipped a small piece of paper into my hand.
One side of this paper was painted black; on the other a single
word, “Friday,” was printed in red ink. I put it in my
pocket and walked on without making any sign or uttering
a word, which was the proper etiquette to observe under
these peculiar circumstances; and in equal silence Willie
returned to the shop.</p>

<p>When I reached the house, though I had been intending
all along to ask for Katherine, I suddenly asked for Gerald
instead.</p>

<p>“Gerald isn’t down yet,” Mrs. Carroll informed me,
coming into the hall from the dining-room. “Probably
he’s not even out of bed. Go up and tell him to hurry.
He’s in the room next yours. Katherine is seeing about
your lunch.”</p>

<p>Rather reluctantly I went up to Gerald’s room and tapped
at his door. “Come in,” he said, sleepily.</p>

<p>He was indeed still in bed, and, in spite of the fact of our
appointment, did not seem in any hurry to get out of it.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s you!” he exclaimed. “Good-morning.”</p>

<p>I felt uncomfortable, for I was sure he would think it
queer my coming into his room when I hardly knew him.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
“Good-morning,” I answered, trying to imitate the tone he
had used. “I was told to tell you to hurry.”</p>

<p>He sat up and yawned. “It’s late, I suppose,” he murmured.
“They hadn’t sense enough to send me up my
breakfast.”</p>

<p>“Do you always have breakfast in your room?” I asked.</p>

<p>He looked out of the window as if I did not interest him.
“No,” he answered, after a perceptible pause, “but I have
it when I want to.”</p>

<p>I felt snubbed. I didn’t know whether to stay or go,
but he decided the matter by telling me to wait till he had
had his bath, that he shouldn’t be long. He put on a
dressing-gown, and left me. When he came back I didn’t
know why he had asked me to stay, for he began to dress
without taking the slightest notice of me. I sat on the edge
of the bed and watched him. It seemed to me stupid that
I should feel slightly in awe of him, but there was no use
pretending that I didn’t. I had already made up my mind
that I disliked him, yet somehow I could not be indifferent
to him—I wanted him to think me important, to admire me.
He was only a year older than I was, but he was infinitely
more a man of the world, and it was this, really, that impressed
me. He dressed very quickly, yet I noticed that
the result was just as harmonious as it had been last night.
His clothes were of a light brown colour, that was exactly
the same shade as his hair, and a little darker than his skin.
A pale violet tie was loosely knotted over a cambric shirt.
His forehead was broad; his yellow-brown eyes were set
widely apart, and were neither large nor small; his nose
was straight and his mouth extraordinarily delicate. His ears
seemed to me, too, to have their own peculiar beauty. His
skin was of a golden-brown colour, but clear almost to
transparency, and a tiny blue vein was faintly visible on his
left temple, running from the delicate eyebrow to the cheekbone.
When he listened his brows slightly wrinkled. I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
would have given a good deal to have looked like
him.</p>

<p>Suddenly I caught his eyes in the mirror watching me
ironically. “Do you know you were extremely rude to me
yesterday?” he said, without turning round.</p>

<p>I blushed and had nothing to reply.</p>

<p>“Well, I forgive you.” He patted me on the shoulder.
“I’m ready now. Come along.”</p>

<p>“Why wouldn’t you play properly when you were
asked?” I blurted out, as we went downstairs.</p>

<p>“I would have played if there had been anybody to play
to. Neither Katherine nor Aunt Clara knows <cite>God save the
Queen</cite> from the <cite>Moonlight Sonata</cite>, and that Dick person is
too absurd for words. I’ll play for you some time when
they aren’t there. And now I must have breakfast;
I won’t keep you very long.... What do you want all
that for?” he asked, as Katherine suddenly appeared with
a large basket.</p>

<p>“For lunch; we’re not going to starve ourselves.”</p>

<p>“Poor Katherine; evidently you’re not. We can each
take our own lunch; a basket like that is only a nuisance.”</p>

<p>“You needn’t carry it,” said Katherine. “You and I
will carry it by turns,” she said to me.</p>

<p>“What’s the use of talking like that,” answered Gerald.
“It doesn’t mean anything. If that huge thing has to be
dragged all the way I shan’t go at all.”</p>

<p>He departed to the dining-room, while Katherine and I
were left standing in the hall, the basket between us.</p>

<p>“We needn’t take any drinkables,” I began, “there’ll be
plenty of water.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t put in any,” said Katherine.</p>

<p>We sat down in the porch to wait for Gerald. When he
rejoined us, which he did very leisurely, I glanced at his
shoes, and suggested that he should change them for something
more substantial.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span></p>

<p>“Why? We’re not going through ploughed fields, are
we? I haven’t any hob-nails even if we were.” A panama
hat shaded his face and he swung a light cane in his hand.
I knew at once we should have difficulty in getting him any
distance, and was very nearly proposing he should stay at
home.</p>

<p>“Why aren’t we driving?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Such nonsense!” exclaimed Katherine. “If Aunt
Clara had wanted us to drive she would have said so.”</p>

<p>“I don’t mind making inquiries,” Gerald intimated. “I
somehow feel it’s the proper thing to drive.”</p>

<p>“You’re not to say anything about it; Aunt Clara won’t
like it, I know.”</p>

<p>“I’ll drive with our young friend Peter, here,” he said
airily, tapping me on the shoulder with his cane.</p>

<p>I could see Katherine was becoming impatient; Gerald
was the only one who was perfectly cool. “About carrying
Katherine’s lunch,” he began. “Hadn’t we better get a
stick and put it through the handle of this thing?” He
kicked the basket lightly. “Then two of us could struggle
with it together.”</p>

<p>The idea was a good one, and we put it into practice.</p>

<p>Our road kept all the way by the coast: on the right,
the mountains; on the left, a strip of waste land, varying in
width, and covered with dry, sapless grass upon which,
nevertheless, there were goats feeding; below this, the steep
drop down to the sea. Shadowless in the strong sun, the
road wound on ahead, white with dust, like a pale ribbon on
the green and russet landscape. We had gone about a mile
when Gerald suddenly announced, “I’m not going any
further; it’s too hot.”</p>

<p>This brought us again to a standstill. “It’s so like you
to spoil everything,” said Katherine.</p>

<p>“What am I spoiling? I suppose I can please myself.
Only, since I’m not coming, I’d advise you to chuck some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
of that grub away.” He took his cigarette-case from his
pocket and offered me a cigarette, which I refused. He lit
one himself.</p>

<p>“You know very well that if you go home Aunt Clara
will think I ought to have come with you, or at any rate be
back for lunch,” said Katherine quietly.</p>

<p>“How should I know such absurd things? And I can’t
help what she thinks, can I?”</p>

<p>“We could have stayed out all day.”</p>

<p>Gerald had begun to whistle an air very softly, and I
recognized it as something he had played last night. His
eyes were fixed on the distant horizon, and he seemed
slightly bored.</p>

<p>“Perhaps if we were to bathe it might make a difference—who
knows? Suppose young Peter and I bathe while you
watch the basket here in this pleasant sunny spot; or you
could walk on slowly with it, and we might in the end even
overtake you?”</p>

<p>I turned to Katherine. “Come along,” I said brusquely.
“What’s the use of bothering about him?”</p>

<p>He looked at me and coloured faintly. “Then I’m to
say you won’t be home till dinner-time?” he asked, speaking
directly to his sister.</p>

<p>Katherine hesitated. “Shall he say that?”</p>

<p>“Let him say what he likes,” I returned, shortly.</p>

<p>We moved on together, and I did not look back, though
Katherine did, more than once. “I’ll make no more arrangements
with your brother,” I remarked.</p>

<p>Katherine was silent. “Perhaps we should come another
day instead?” she began presently, and in a hesitating way.</p>

<p>“You mean you are going to give in to him?” I said,
making up my mind that there should be no other day, so
far as I was concerned.</p>

<p>She was again silent, and meanwhile we continued to
walk on. I could see she was uncertain as to what she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
ought to do, that she did not want to disappoint me, and
that, on the other hand, she was not sure about Gerald.
“He’s offended at something,” she began. “He takes
offence very easily.... He thinks you didn’t want him.”</p>

<p>“Why should he think that?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know.... But it is something of that sort, I’m
sure.”</p>

<p>I was going to say that I did not care a straw what he
thought, but checked myself. “He didn’t appear to me
to be offended,” I replied. “It was simply that he thought
it too much fag.”</p>

<p>“You don’t know him,” said Katherine.</p>

<p>And we continued to trudge along, our feet white with
dust. It really <em>was</em> very hot, and I was glad I had so little
clothing on—merely a light cotton tennis-shirt under my
jacket. When we reached a low grey bridge that spanned a
shallow mountain stream we branched inland. This was
the Bloody Bridge, I told Katherine, and a religious massacre
had once taken place here. I pointed out the remains
of an old church, with its fallen tombs, and after resting for
a few minutes we began to climb the valley, which was the
walk I had proposed to take them. This valley was wonderfully
beautiful, widening out gradually, and gradually
ascending; on each side of it steep dark mountains, covered
with heather, and grass, and gorse, and hidden streams which
flowed into the broader, deeper stream we followed. The
colouring was rich and splendid—dull gold, bronze, dark
green and even black, with the brighter purple of the heather
woven through it, and the long, narrow, pale, silver streak
of water, glittering and gleaming, far, far up, till in the end
it was lost over the edge of a higher valley which crossed
ours at right angles.</p>

<p>“These are the Mourne Mountains?” Katherine asked
gazing up at them. “I’ve seen them from the Isle of Man.
On a clear day you can make them out quite distinctly.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span></p>

<p>She began to talk to me about mountains, about Switzerland,
where she had been last spring, and I felt ashamed
never to have been anywhere. Yet, while she was describing
it, I had an instinct that I should not like Switzerland.
By some chance I indeed pictured it very much as, later on,
I was actually to find it. Katherine’s enthusiasm could
not remove this conviction: in fact, what she said, secretly
strengthened my idea that it must be an odious country,
and, years later, amid all the showy banality of its picturesqueness,
I remembered this particular walk, and my
own beautiful dark country rose up before me, with its
sombre hills, its dreamy, changing sky.</p>

<p>But at the time I had nothing to say, I had no comparisons
to make, I had seen nothing. “I should like to go to a big
city like London or Paris,” I told her, “not to live there,
but to see it.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe you’d like it.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know.... You’re so much a part of all
this.” She glanced up at the hills.</p>

<p>“Do <em>you</em> like cities?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I simply love them; but then I’m quite different.”</p>

<p>“I’d like the picture galleries any way,” I declared.</p>

<p>“Are you fond of pictures?”</p>

<p>“I’ve not seen many—only reproductions.”</p>

<p>“I’m fond of them too. There was a splendid picture in
the Academy this year of a girl skating. She was holding
a muff up to her face so that it covered her mouth and chin,
but she was awfully pretty, and when you came into the
room you would just think she was a real person. And the
snow was so nice, with a sort of pink light on it. If you come
over to London I’ll take you to see everything.”</p>

<p>But again, just as in the case of Switzerland, my instinct
told me I should detest this picture. For a moment I
had a feeling of depression; it seemed to me of infinite<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
importance that Katherine should like the things that I
liked.</p>

<p>“I don’t care for pretty pictures,” I said. “I hate
everything pretty,” I went on almost angrily.</p>

<p>“Would you rather have ugly ones?” asked Katherine,
laughing, as if she had caught me in an absurdity. I had
no answer to give, though I knew myself exactly what I
meant. I felt lonely and melancholy. Then I looked at
Katherine. She was very beautiful, and in a quite different
way from her brother. And suddenly I knew where I had
seen her before—her eyes, at least—they were the eyes of
Prudence Carroll.... I gazed at her, seeking some further
resemblance, but could discover none. Her skin was very
white, save where in her cheeks it flushed to a soft radiant
glow. Her brown, crisp hair was pulled back straight from
her forehead, though one or two little tufts had got loose and
waved in the faint wind. Her nose and mouth had the
same delicate beauty as Gerald’s, but her expression was
quite different, and it was there that her greatest beauty lay....
Yes, there again was a resemblance to Prudence
Carroll—her expression was the same as Prudence Carroll’s.
She had the same eyes, the same expression ... perhaps,
then, the same spirit.... A sort of daydream had begun
to weave itself into my thoughts.</p>

<p>“How far can we go this way?” Katherine interrupted me.</p>

<p>“As far as you can see. There is another valley beyond.
We could go along it and home over Slieve Donard, but it
is a long distance.”</p>

<p>We climbed slowly, not talking very much. It was past
noon now, and hotter than ever, and when we reached a deep
green pool under a waterfall we stopped to bathe our hands
and faces in it. Its cool sweetness was alluring, as if a water-sprite
sang up through it into the hot sunlight, and the white
spray sparkled in the sun. “It would be splendid for a
bathe,” I murmured.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span></p>

<p>“Bathe if you want to; I can walk on and you can overtake
me.”</p>

<p>I remembered Gerald, however, and refused to do this,
being full to the brim just now of unselfishness and chivalry.
“We might have our lunch here,” I suggested. “Then we
could hide the basket somewhere, and not be bothered by it
again till we are going home.”</p>

<p>We spread a napkin on a broad flat stone, and our lunch on
top of that. I now discovered why the basket had been so
heavy, but, though it had been a nuisance carrying it, its
contents were extremely welcome. We had almost finished
when a peculiar feeling rather than a sound made me look
up, and I saw a man standing not more than three or
four yards from us. It was as if he had risen out of the
earth. When you are under the impression that you are
miles away from any human being, such a sudden apparition
is a little startling, nor was the appearance of this visitor
reassuring. He was large and pale, with short brown hair,
and at the back of his head he wore a cap, like a boy’s cap,
which was too small for him. His clothes, without being
ragged, were stained and worn, and of a nondescript,
brownish colour. He was young, probably between twenty-five
and thirty, and strongly built. There was something
coldly malevolent in the pale, clean-shaved face, something
indescribably corrupt and cruel, which seemed to stare out
of the hard brown eyes, and to hover about the smiling lips.
He stood before us, looking down in obvious enjoyment of
our discomfiture, making no movement to pass on. It was
curious that features so perfectly regular, features neither
bloated nor disfigured, could give so vivid an impression of
ugliness. It was the ugliness of something positively evil,
and my first feeling was one of instinctive repugnance and
disgust, as if I had been touched by an obscene and noxious
creature. I felt, I can’t say why, that I was in the presence
of something actively dangerous, and not only to my body,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
but reaching beyond that: I felt as if I were in the presence
of some form of spiritual corruption or decay, that I knew
nothing about, and that yet I had a horror of, as a young
rabbit is afraid of a hawk. That prolonged, impudent stare,
passing over me, seemed to leave a trail of filth, of slime, of
something that defiled like a loathsome caress. His eyes
slid from me to Katherine with the same repulsive scrutiny.
What was he doing here? He was no country man. As
my first startled feeling passed, my temper began to rise.
“What do you want?” I asked. “How much longer are
you going to stand there?”</p>

<p>He laughed almost noiselessly, though he still neither
moved nor spoke. It was as if the sound of his laugh
touched a spring within me, and I lifted a sharp piece of
stone lying near my feet. I felt a sudden rage, an extraordinary
desire to destroy. I could actually feel my lips
draw back ever so little, just like the lips of an angry terrier.
I had no longer the faintest sensation of fear: on the
contrary, what I wanted was for him to make a movement
forward, a gesture that I could take as threatening. And
the rough, natural weapon I had picked up must have
acquired a sudden appearance of dangerousness, for our
visitor drew back and his face altered. Then he laughed
more loudly and on a different note as he passed on his
way down the valley. I felt elated. Somehow, I was
certain my stone would not have missed its mark, and
that there would have been no hesitation, no lack of force,
on the part of the wielder. Katherine and I watched
him as he retreated, now disappearing from our sight,
and now again appearing, but always at a point farther
down.</p>

<p>“Well, he’s gone,” I said. “He was horrible looking.”
I faced her with a proud consciousness of having behaved
very well.</p>

<p>“Do you know what <em>you</em> looked like?” asked Katherine.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
And before I could answer: “You looked just like David
when he threw the stone.”</p>

<p>I blushed. Then, “I never cared much for David,” I
answered ungraciously, and moreover untruly, for I was,
secretly, extremely pleased and flattered.</p>

<p>“Neither did I till a minute ago, but that was because
I didn’t know what he was like.”</p>

<p>My blush deepened. “Well, the beast’s gone at any rate,”
I said to cover my gratification. “I will tell Michael
when we get home. He can’t be prowling about here for
any good.”</p>

<p>“Who is Michael?”</p>

<p>“One of our policemen—the decentest.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>We hid the basket under the heather. A quiet had
fallen upon us, through which the noise of the splashing
water seemed to weave itself in patterns and arabesques
of sound.</p>

<p>“Shall we go up higher?” I asked, and without answering
me Katherine began to climb the hill-side, and I
followed her over dry, springy, fragrant heather, and
between huge mossy boulders that had lain undisturbed
for centuries. We stopped to look at a fly-catching plant,
that curious, unpleasant mixture of the animal and the
vegetable. Katherine had never seen one before, and she
examined the outspread, concave disc, with the skeletons,
the grey husks of flies, adhering to its green surface. We
found a bee struggling on his back on the purple flower of
a thistle, waving his legs in the air, a ridiculous picture of
intoxication. But in spite of these interruptions the silence
that had crept over us lingered still. When we reached
a place where the ground rose steeply for a yard or two
I gave Katherine my hand to help her, and when we came
to more level ground we still went on hand in hand. And
with this light contact there came to me a strange, thrilling<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
pleasure, intense yet dreamy, unlike anything I had ever
known before. I did not look at my companion. When
I spoke, telling her to avoid a patch of soft ground that had
here spread across the path, the sound of my own voice
astonished me, so unfamiliar was it, even trembling slightly;
and I felt my limbs trembling. But why should it be so?
What was there? Why was I nervous? Nothing had
happened but this short easy climb hand in hand. I threw
my hat from me and flung myself down among the heather,
lying with my hands clasped behind my head, and my face
turned up to the dark blue sky. Far, far below us, the sea,
blue and deep, broad, beautiful and free, lay shimmering
in the hot sun. I had a sensation of intense happiness,
physical and mental, into which I seemed to be sinking
deep and deeper. I felt my eyes grow moist, and I turned
away my head that my companion might not see my face.</p>

<p>Presently I looked round. Katherine was sitting beside
me, gazing straight out at the distant sea. The broad brim
of her black hat shadowed her face. The deep blue of her
eyes seemed darker than before; they had the blue now of
the eyes Renoir so often painted, and that I have seen
nowhere else. I wanted to say something, I hardly knew
what. I hovered shyly on the verge of it, like a timid
bather on the brink of the sea, but there was no one to push
me in, and my plunge was not taken.</p>

<p>“It’s jolly nice here!” Those feeble words were all I
could find to express the rapid rush of emotion that had
shaken my whole being. The vast and complex forces of
nature were stirring within me almost as unconsciously
as the new leaf germinates in the growing plant. Yet there
was something which, without any words at all, I must have
expressed, had there been an observer to see it. I mean
the helplessness of youth, its pathetic credulity and good
faith, its brightness and briefness in the face of those hoary
old hills, and of feelings that were almost as ancient.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span></p>

<p>I sat up and clasped my hands about my knees. “I
wonder what it will be like living in town?” I said.</p>

<p>“Yes, you’re going away next month, aren’t you?
Aunt Clara told me.”</p>

<p>“My father wanted me to try for a post in a Government
office. There is a boy who lives here who is going to do
that: he is working for his exam. now.” Then I added, I
don’t know why; “Mrs. Carroll is paying for me, and will
be afterwards, when I go to college. I’m to go to one of
the English universities—Oxford, I think. Of course my
father couldn’t afford to send me, and indeed he’d rather I
didn’t go at all. He let me decide, however, though there
was really only one thing that made him give in.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“My mother once sent money to be used for my education,
and he would not take it.”</p>

<p>Katherine was mystified, and, as I saw this, it dawned
on me that I should not have spoken. I had taken it for
granted that she knew all about me.</p>

<p>“You know, my mother doesn’t live at home,” I explained;
and then, to change the subject, I took the piece
of paper Willie Breen had given me that morning from my
pocket.</p>

<p>“Can you guess what that is?” I asked.</p>

<p>She turned it over.</p>

<p>“It means that on Friday there will be a meeting of a
kind of club we have,” I said. “It is a night club. The
whole thing is a secret. We have supper round a fire, and
talk, and tell yarns, and all that.”</p>

<p>“Outside?”</p>

<p>“Yes; over on the golf-links usually.”</p>

<p>“But why at night?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know. Pretty late too—about half-past
eleven or twelve. I got it up last year with some of the
boys who were staying down here. And then, afterwards,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
I kept it up with two or three of the chaps at school. This
year I got sick of it, and I’ve only been to one meeting.”</p>

<p>“At night! It must be rather queer. I love the sea at
night. Are you allowed to bring visitors?”</p>

<p>“There is no rule; there are no rules of any kind. Would
you like to come?”</p>

<p>Katherine hesitated. Then she laughed. “Yes. Would
it matter?”</p>

<p>“There’ll be nobody but boys there.”</p>

<p>“But you’d take me; and of course, Gerald would
come.”</p>

<p>“I’ll take you if you’ll come by yourself,” I said.</p>

<p>“Without Gerald? I couldn’t. What harm would he
do?”</p>

<p>I did not say; but without Gerald I knew I could carry
the thing off, with him it would be difficult. “You’d
have to promise not to tell anybody,” I explained.</p>

<p>“Of course. If I told, I shouldn’t be there myself.”</p>

<p>“But I mean even afterwards.”</p>

<p>“I’ll not tell.”</p>

<p>For a minute or two we looked down the hill-side, bathed
in the afternoon sun; then I made up my mind. “If you
can promise that Gerald won’t talk about it I’ll take you.
But won’t you find it difficult to get out?” I added immediately
afterwards.</p>

<p>“No; we’ll simply sit up later than the others. They
seem to go to bed about ten.”</p>

<p>“But the lodge-gate will be locked.”</p>

<p>“I can easily manage about that.”</p>

<p>I regretted having mentioned the matter at all, yet I
hadn’t the courage to draw back. “I’ll tell you on Friday
morning exactly when to be ready,” I said.</p>

<p>We sat silent. Katherine had taken off her hat and
it lay on the ground beside her; she was fastening a bunch of
heather into her blue and white muslin dress.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span></p>

<p>“Have you looked at the portraits in the long passage
yet?” I asked suddenly.</p>

<p>“Yes; not very particularly, but I noticed there were
some.”</p>

<p>“Did you see one of a dark lady standing by a spinet,
holding a bunch of flowers?”</p>

<p>“I don’t remember. Who is she?”</p>

<p>“Prudence Carroll,” I answered. “Look at her when
you go in.”</p>

<p>Katherine had completed her task. “Why?” she
inquired, turning to me.</p>

<p>“I think she is very like you—or you are very like her.”</p>

<p>“I shall see; but suppose I don’t care for her?”</p>

<p>“Then you can say I’m a fool. But you will care for
her—at any rate, I do. I don’t mean that your features are
just the same as hers.”</p>

<p>“And I’m not dark, am I?”</p>

<p>“No; at all events not <em>so</em> dark. However, you will see
what I mean—perhaps you will see.”</p>

<p>“You’re not sure? It can’t be so very striking then.”</p>

<p>“That’s just what it is—it <em>is</em> striking. It mayn’t, however,
be exactly obvious to everybody. When I first saw
you, I kept wondering who you were like. I couldn’t get at
it for a long time—then I knew.”</p>

<p>“Well, I never even heard of her, but I’m shockingly
ignorant of my ancestors.”</p>

<p>“She wasn’t an ancestor: she was never married; the
likeness isn’t physical.”</p>

<p>“Oh, then I shan’t see it. Besides, I never <em>do</em> see likenesses,
even when they’re much less mysterious than this.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,—perhaps, in a way, it is mysterious. I
can see it more clearly sometimes than others. I don’t
think I should see it at all if you were asleep or dead.”</p>

<p>“What a horrid idea!” She laughed, but not quite
easily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span></p>

<p>“Do you not feel that these hills are familiar to you?”
I asked dreamily. “I can imagine a person coming to some
house like Derryaghy for the first time, and then finding that
he knew this room and that, where this passage led to, what
view he should see when he looked out through that little
window at the top of the stairs. Or it might be that two
people would come there together, and everything they said
would sound like an echo from something that had been
spoken before, and each, while they waited for it, would
know the answer, before it had left the other’s lips.”</p>

<p>“I’m not sure that I follow you,” said Katherine prosaically,
“but I imagine you are trying to make out that I
may be what-do-you-call-her Carroll come to life again.
You’re the strangest boy I ever met.”</p>

<p>“You told me I was like David. But—but—pretend
it for a moment. Say you were Prudence Carroll, then who
should I be?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t any idea. Perhaps the apprentice of the artist
who painted her picture, if he had an apprentice.”</p>

<p>I considered this. It had never occurred to me before.
But I could not get back, I could not discover even a faint
gleam. It was not the time; I was too saturated with my
actual surroundings.</p>

<p>I did not pursue the subject, for I saw it had no interest for
Katherine. Besides, I wanted to be quiet. I thought
if we sat in silence, if I held her hand; above all, if we sat in
silence close together, her arms about me, my cheek against
her cheek, the past might swim up into the present, and we
should know. But instead of that we began to talk, to talk
of things that did not matter, until, by and by, we got up
to return home.</p>

</div>


<p>I stayed in the house all the evening, but I could not read,
and so I sat down to write to Katherine. I wrote for more
than an hour, though I was very doubtful whether, in the
end, I should post my letter. It was the first time in my
life I had ever written to anybody. Of course I cannot
remember now what I said: I can remember the sense of
it, or the nonsense, possibly, but not how I expressed it.
Very badly, I suppose, for I tore my first attempt up, and
began another, over which I must have spent an even longer
time, since, to finish it, I was obliged to get up and light
the lamp. When I went out to the post it was quite dark,
and immediately after I had dropped my letter in the box
I had a strong desire to get it back again. Why had I been
in such a hurry? I should have kept it till morning. Then,
as I pictured Katherine reading it, a thrill of pleasure swept
through my timidity.</p>

<p>I did not go home, but strolled, instead, over the golf-links
in the direction of the sea. At such an hour they were
absolutely deserted, and the pale sand-hills, stretching
away in the moonlight and beside a dark waste of water,
wore an unfamiliar, a slightly weird aspect, suggestive of
some desolate lunar landscape. I wandered on, utterly
oblivious to time, till I found a comfortable spot between
two of these hills, on a gentle slope that was almost like a
couch. I was filled with a passionate sense of life, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
lying there, with the long thin sapless grass about me and
above me, and the soft white powdery sand beneath, I
could look out over the sea, and feel myself perfectly
alone. The water was a dark mass under the moon, darker
than the beach, darker than the sky, but not so dark as
the Mourne Mountains, which rose away on my left in
smooth, bold, black curves.</p>

<p>There was no wind. Down in the hollow where I lay
I was as sheltered as I should have been in bed. The night
was washed through with the soft sound of the waves as
they splashed in a long curving line on the flat strand that
stretched on round to Dundrum, three miles away. Moths
hovered above me with a beating of pale delicate wings;
and all around, like a vast background for the sound of the
sea, was the deep, rich, summer silence of the slumbering
world, a silence of unending music, as though the great,
living earth were breathing softly in its sleep. I lay on my
back, and above me was the vast, deep vault of the sky,
full of a floating darkness, in which the white moon hovered
like a ghost. And I lay there in luxurious enjoyment of
the night, and of the life that was running through my own
body. It seemed to me at that moment as if my spirit
were no longer merely passively receptive of what was
borne in upon it, but that it had actually taken wing, had
grown lighter, more volatile, were flowing out through the
surrounding atmosphere, through the sky and the sea, were
moving with the movement of the water. The earth beneath
me was living and breathing, and, obedient to some
obscure prompting of my body, I turned round and pressed
my mouth against the dry grass, closer and closer, in a long
silent embrace.</p>

<p>It was very well there was no one to observe this exhibition
of primitive and eternal instinct. I felt a passionate
happiness and excitement. My head was bare, the salt
sharp smell of the sea seemed to have set all my nerves<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
tingling, and I unfastened my shirt that my breast might
be bare also. All the past had slipped from me, and I
lived in this moment, squeezing out its ecstasy to the last
drop, as I might the juice of some ripe fruit. It seemed to
me that I was on the brink of finding something for which
all my previous existence had been but one long preparation
and search. I was fumbling at the door of an enchanted
garden: in a moment it would swing open: already the
perfume of unknown flowers and fruits was in my nostrils.
My feeling was deep and pure and clear as a forest pool.
In my mind I went over the story of Shakespeare’s “Venus
and Adonis.” I thought of the shepherd-boy Endymion.
I imagined myself Endymion, as I lay there half naked in
the moonlight. My eyes dimmed and the blood raced
through my veins; it was as if the heart of the summer
had suddenly opened out, like a gorgeous flower, and
brought me some strange rapture....</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>When I awakened to more commonplace things I knew
that it was very late indeed. I wondered what had possessed
me, and what story I should tell my father standing there
in the hall, holding up a candle, looking at me before he
turned round to fasten the chain. I raced home to the
fulfilment of this vision, but it was already past midnight,
and my father would not listen to my excuses. He was
very angry indeed, but his anger could not come between
me and my happiness. I listened to it in a kind of dream,
and as soon as a pause came, slipped away from it and
on upstairs. In the dark, as I undressed, the delicate scent
of heather still clinging to my clothes filled the small bedroom,
and seemed to bring the whole day back to me from
the beginning. Comfortably between the cool sheets I
went over every incident of it, while the scent of heather
still floated about me; and now I had acquired an extraordinary
bravery; I gave utterance to every thought arising<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
in my mind; the embrace which had been so impossible was
perfectly easy. One by one exquisite pictures drifted
in through the windows of my closed eyes; one by one
they opened out before me, like flowers, full of delicious
sweetness, and in the midst of them I fell asleep.</p>

<p>But my sleep was only a completer realization of my
waking thoughts. I was again with Katherine, and again
we were alone on the mountain-side. We were coming
home and I was a little behind her, when she stooped to
gather a handful of heather. But instead of fastening it
into her dress she turned and flung it at me, and then ran on
down the hill. I followed quickly, and all at once she
stopped running and we stood there, hot and panting and
laughing. Then she impulsively lifted her face, and I
kissed her. I held her close to me and kissed her again
and again.... And the scent of heather floated about
my bed, the heather of reality mingling with the heather
of my dream.</p>

<p>During the morning my father kept me working in the
garden where he was erecting a kind of arch of trellis-work
above the gate, but after our early dinner I went up to
Derryaghy. Ever since I had awakened, my mind had
been filled with the letter I had written, and with guesses as
to how it would affect Katherine. I hurried along, for our
dinner was at two, while their lunch was at one, and I had
made no appointment, so that when I reached the house,
and found they were all gone out, I was not greatly surprised.
Katherine and Gerald had gone out riding; they would be
back for tea. I left a message to say I would call some
time in the evening and went upstairs to choose a book.
In the silent library the faint sound of my feet on the thick
carpet made little more noise than the rustle of a ghost,
and when I had found what I wanted I paused with the
book unopened in my hand. Through the window I could
look out into the afternoon garden, sunlit and mellow, but
in the house itself the silence of those upper rooms struck
me, as always, with a suggestion of a faint, bygone life, of
spiritual presences, unseen, yet watching and listening. I
walked slowly down the passage, looking at the portraits,
and trying to picture the lives of those who had sat for
them. Were they aware of my scrutiny, of my curiosity,
possibly indiscreet? did I disturb the dust of the past, did
they welcome or, perchance, resent my intrusion into that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
delicate dream-life that had fallen upon them? I loved to
amuse myself with such fancies, idle enough, not to be
communicated to others. The air seemed heavy with a
kind of still, intense reverie, through which there came the
vibration of a hidden mysterious life. Were I the true son
of the house, I told myself, a sign of recognition might have
been given to me; but I was a stranger, an intruder, and
my robuster, noisier presence could but disturb their
ethereal existence. There was something almost vulgar in
being physically alive among that shadowy company. I
longed to pass the threshold of their world and learn its
secrets. Perhaps if I were really to love that dark, sweet
lady, Prudence Carroll, to declare my love, to kiss her painted
lips, I might be admitted to it. Would she be jealous when
I left her? To love a dream, a memory, that was very
possible; but to be faithful to it? Through the door I
had left ajar a golden stream of sunlight, filled with floating
specks of dust, swam across the shadowed passage, and just
touched the flowers in her hand. But my ghosts had never
been afraid of sunlight: they were not afraid to walk in the
deserted garden or to pass me on the stairs or in the hall.
Often I had felt them to be there, and some day, I knew, I
should see them. With this thought there came to me a
desire to revisit their own garden, a walled place of dark
green graves, where they wandered undisturbed.</p>

<p>I went out, forgetting after all my book, and took a short
cut across the fields and down a disused, mossy lane, purple
with tall foxgloves, and sleepy with droning bees, which
brought me out abruptly at the old church. Service was
still held here, and as I came up I saw the door was open.
I went inside, and an old woman who was dusting the pews
wished me good-day. I talked to her for a few minutes
and then began to wander idly about, trying my Latin on
the inscriptions, peeping behind doors and through windows.
A church on a week-day was for me quite a different thing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
from a church on a Sunday. Its quiet appealed to me, a
sort of homely, gentle charm that was at once dissipated
by the entrance of a congregation. I went into the pulpit
and imagined myself preaching, while the old woman,
Margaret Beattie, leaned on the handle of her broom and
watched me.</p>

<p>“You’d make the queer fine curate, Master Peter,” she
said, evidently seeing in this exhibition the betrayal of a
vocation.</p>

<p>“They’ll never get me, Margaret,” I replied. “The
Church is not what it was. I believe you are an old witch,”
I went on, for she was half-deaf, “and when you have done
your mischief here, you will ride away on that broomstick.”</p>

<p>I went out into the sunshine and pottered about among
the graves. All were old, for nobody was ever buried here
now. Most of the head-stones were stained green with age
and weather, and the lettering was so worn that it was often
necessary to peer close to read a name or a date. I lingered
in the corner where lay the bones of some of those fine ladies
and gentlemen whose pictures I had been looking at. Well,
it was a pleasant place....</p>

<p>Margaret came out, locking the door after her. I heard
her shambling feet on the gravel, followed by the clanging
of the iron gate that left me to myself. Had my ghosts
preceded me here, or did they still linger in the upper rooms
at Derryaghy? I threaded my way among the graves to the
low, sun-warmed wall, all golden and green and grey with
velvet moss on weathered stone. Before me lay the broad
open country I must cross to go home, rich and dark in
the late afternoon light. The gleam of water, of pool and
stream, shone palely amid long grass and darker gorse
bushes: and beyond were trees, black and soft against the
western sky, as if rubbed in by a dusky thumb. Distant
hills stood out from the grey clouds and the softer, deeper
background of luminous sky. Everything shimmered and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
gleamed in a kind of romantic richness and divine softness
that I was to see later in dreamy landscapes by Perugino.
And over all was a great sea of light and sky—grey, faint
green, and deeper, warmer yellow, with clear silver where
the water lay.</p>

<p>I turned from it and sat down on the wall, facing the
churchyard. It was a quiet spot, designed for contemplation.
The faint wind in the trees was like a low pleasant
tune, and there was nothing melancholy in its charm. To
me it had a kind of happy beauty which I loved. I had
fallen into a mood when I seemed close to my dreamland.
It lay beyond an enchanted sea, whose shore was that bright
cloud there. I could hear the low, continuous sound of
surf breaking on the pale glistening sand; I could see deep
lagoons, and sleepy rivers winding slowly down through
green lawns and meadowlands. I tried to draw nearer, but
it swam away from me, leaving only a broken cloud, and
beyond that the endless sky. Had it already been, or was it
still to come? Was all this world, apparently so solid under
my feet, but my dream, and should I presently awaken to
that other? I had a sudden temptation to risk everything:
the fascination of death stole over me, quickening my
curiosity to know what lay beyond. Only <em>should</em> I know?
Death might not really solve anything! If I tried to force
an entrance I might lose my only chance of finding one. A
large, splendid butterfly, a red admiral, flitted over the wall
and perched on one of the grave-stones, spreading his
gorgeous wings, black and crimson, flat against the grey,
sun-baked stone. He remained there with the stillness of
a painted thing, drinking in the heat, knowing nothing save
that.</p>

<p>The afternoon was waning. The sun had crept down
the sky till he was almost hidden, and the violet shadows
were blurred on the tangled grass. Again one of those
strange, breathless silences seemed to wash up as from some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
depth of Time, and I listened—listened for a sign, a word,
for in the stillness the faintest whisper would have reached
me. What were they, these strange pauses in life, in
everything—these feelings of suspense, of expectation?
A kind of ineffable happiness and peace descended upon
me. A delicate spirit of beauty seemed to be wandering
through the unmown grass, which bent beneath its feet,
wandering under the broad-leaved trees, beside the grey old
church. Surely there was something of which all this was
only the reflection! I could feel it; I knew it. What
did it mean? what was I waiting for? what was it I
desired? I thought of my soul as a little candle-flame,
hovering at my lips, ready to take flight. If I blew it
from me it might flicker away over the grass, down into
the graves, up into the air, a tiny tongue of flame, no bigger
than a piece of thistledown. I thought of the old, silent,
listening house, darkening now to twilight, mysterious,
haunted, with its closed doors and brown portraits: a
dream-thing that, too, and all the ghosts who lived there.</p>

<p>It was half-past eight when I left home to go to Derryaghy,
but at the corner of the Bryansford Road I met Willie
Breen and stopped to get particulars about our meeting
to-morrow night. I did not mention the Dales because
I was almost sure that in the end Katherine would not
come, and in the midst of our talk he broke off abruptly
with: “Here’s your fine friends,” delivered half-contemptuously.
At the same time he stuck his hands in his
pockets and strolled off whistling.</p>

<p>I wheeled round to face Miss Dick and Katherine and
Gerald coming towards me. I raised my straw hat.</p>

<p>“We’re just going as far as the station and back,” said
Katherine. “We thought we’d meet you.”</p>

<p>I dropped with her a little behind the others and walked
as slowly as I could.</p>

<p>“I got your letter,” she went on, simply. “It was very
nice of you to write, but I hope you didn’t want an answer.
Letters are beyond me.”</p>

<p>“You weren’t angry?” I asked, timidly.</p>

<p>“No. What was there to be angry about? Of course,
I couldn’t make out what it all meant: you didn’t intend
me, I suppose, to take it quite seriously: but it seemed
very flattering and poetic.... I was sorry we weren’t
in when you came for us. Tell me what you did with
yourself all afternoon.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span></p>

<p>“I walked out to the old graveyard and sat there,” I
replied.</p>

<p>“How cheerful!”</p>

<p>“It was rather: at any rate I liked it.... Let us
go along here,” I added. “We can get home round this
way. It is a good deal longer, but— Do you mind?”</p>

<p>“Not if it doesn’t keep us too late.”</p>

<p>“I have been thinking about the artist’s apprentice,”
I began. “Do you smell the meadow-sweet?”</p>

<p>“The artist’s apprentice? Oh, yes! Well, what were
you thinking about him?”</p>

<p>“That he must paint your portrait.”</p>

<p>“But can he?”</p>

<p>“He can try, like other apprentices.”</p>

<p>“When?”</p>

<p>“Any time. To-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Really? Do you paint?”</p>

<p>“Only a little in water-colours. I’ve not had any
lessons.”</p>

<p>“And you’ve made pictures?”</p>

<p>“No, just a few sketches. I never finish anything.
Just something to remind me of—things.”</p>

<p>“You must show them to me.”</p>

<p>“If you like; but you won’t see anything in them;
nobody ever does. They’re only meant for myself—and
they’re no use anyway.”</p>

<p>“What did you really mean by your letter, Peter?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know—burn it. I meant everything that’s
there, but I’m not sure now what <em>is</em> there. After I had
written it I went out and lay down on the golf-links and
listened to the sea.... Would you like me to take you
to my old graveyard? I expect you’ll be going to church
there on Sunday.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean now?”</p>

<p>“Yes. It’s not far away—just across those fields.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span></p>

<p>We walked on through the scented darkness.</p>

<p>“I don’t know that I like graveyards,” said Katherine,
doubtfully.</p>

<p>“I don’t either—new ones—but this is very old.”</p>

<p>I helped her across the stile. Out of the shadow of the
tall hedge, the grassy country lay grey and unsubstantial
under the rising moon. The black spire of the church
showed through the trees, and in a little while we reached
the low wall where I had sat all the afternoon. But how
changed the place was! Flooded with fantastic moonlight,
only the shadows now seemed real.</p>

<p>“You do not want to go inside?” Katherine asked,
dissuasively.</p>

<p>“No; we can see it from here.” And I leaned over the
low wall. “It is not like a modern cemetery,” I again told
her. “There is nothing horrid here. There are no bodies;—nothing
but a little dust, and a few spirits, perhaps, that
have not gone away.”</p>

<p>“Ghosts? Are you not afraid of them?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. Not now, at any rate; these ghosts are
friendly; they are so old.”</p>

<p>“Have you seen them?”</p>

<p>“No. I saw one at home in my bedroom when I was a
little chap, but it was not nice; it was not like these....
You are buried here,” I added, smiling.</p>

<p>But Katherine turned away quickly. “Don’t,” she said.
“Why do you like to be so morbid? Besides, I don’t think
it is right.”</p>

<p>I could see that I had vexed her, and I changed the
subject.</p>

<p>Down by the grave just below us the tiny green light of a
glow-worm glimmered, but I did not point it out to Katherine.
A fairy tale of Hans Andersen’s came into my mind, and
I saw Death, like an old gardener, floating over the wall with
a soul, like a baby, folded in his arms; and I watched him<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
lay it softly to sleep under the trees. I had forgotten all
the details of the story, but I made a story for myself, and
the moonlight on the grass and on the weather-worn grave-stones,
and the black, lurking shadows, and the still, moon-drenched
church, wove into it a mysterious beauty. It
seemed to me that something might happen now that would
make, for me at least, all things different for ever after, that
would push the boundaries of life infinitely further back,
by bringing a dimmer, vaster world directly into relation
with me. In that world, perhaps, they dreamed of this, just
as I was now dreaming of it.</p>

<p>I was aroused by Katherine. “We must go, Peter.”
She laid her hand on my arm.</p>

<p>“All right.”</p>

<p>I took a last look, and then stepped out briskly beside her.</p>

<p>“I oughtn’t to have brought you here,” I said, “out of
your way.”</p>

<p>“I enjoyed coming. I am not in any hurry myself, but
you know how early they go to bed, and it must be getting
late.”</p>

<p>“Do you like me, Katherine,” I asked, pleasantly.</p>

<p>“If I had disliked you I don’t suppose I should have
tramped all these miles with you.”</p>

<p>“You are sure I don’t bore you, or anything?”</p>

<p>“Not up to the present. Why do you ask?” she smiled.</p>

<p>“I just wanted to make sure. Girls, as a rule, would
rather have older people than I am—wouldn’t they—fellows
like the curate? I only mention him because you
happen to have met him. You’re seventeen, which means
that you’re grown up, and——”</p>

<p>“I can’t make up my mind what you are,” Katherine
interrupted, laughing aloud. “The first night I saw you
you were frightened to open your mouth, and now you’re
saying all kinds of things.”</p>

<p>“That shouldn’t be said?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span></p>

<p>“No; I like them. I daresay in ten years’ time I won’t
care to be told how old I am, but at present it’s all right.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t mean anything except that there’s a difference
between us. Girls often get married at seventeen.”</p>

<p>“I think, you know, you’re rather a dear in your own
way,” she said, thoughtfully.</p>

</div>


<p>It was late, and the house was quiet. When I leaned out
of my window I could hear the sound of the waves, but no
other sound; then I opened my bedroom door softly, and
crept out into the passage. From my father’s room there
came a heavy, muffled snoring as I made my way downstairs.
The hall-door I unfastened with the same elaborate
precautions against noise, but I left it open behind me, only
slipping in the door-mat to keep it from slamming. Once
outside, I felt safe.</p>

<p>The night was clear and full of moonlight, and my black
shadow danced fantastically before me on the white, bare
road. Not a soul was abroad, and as I walked I had a
curious sense of freedom and exhilaration; old songs of
romance and adventure hummed in my ears, and I wanted
them to come true. Contrary to my expectation and to my
desire, Katherine and Gerald were waiting for me at the
lodge-gate, in the shadow of the hawthorn hedge, and
Katherine held a parcel in her hand.</p>

<p>We did not talk very much as we went quickly on,
following the same road we had taken on the morning of our
picnic. I kept a sharp look-out, but could see no sign of any
of the other boys. Below us, on our left, the sea murmured
and splashed through the warm delicious night; on the
right, the Mourne Mountains rose, black against the
sky.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span></p>

<p>“I’m afraid we’re rather late,” I remarked after a while.
Then I added, “You’ll have to take an oath of secrecy.”</p>

<p>I had already told them all they would have to do, but I
was a little nervous, for I had no idea what kind of reception
they would get, and to help to tide matters over I had
recommended Katherine, if she came, to bring a supply of
provisions, which would always be so much in their favour.
For myself I didn’t care a straw, though I knew what I was
doing would make me unpopular.</p>

<p>We had walked for about a quarter of an hour and had
left the village well behind us when down towards Maggie’s
Leap I saw the red glow of a bonfire. We turned to the
sea, clambering over the rough ground, till presently, in
a hollow, we saw them, seven or eight boys, sitting round
a fire. Thirty feet below, the sea looked black and strange;
and the mysterious night floated about us, a night of
wonderful beauty.</p>

<p>There was an awkward moment when we advanced into
the firelight, and before I introduced them. A silence
followed my very lame speech, in the chill of which Gerald
lit a cigarette, and we took our seats, slightly beyond the
main circle. Nobody made room for us, and when Katherine
produced her contributions to the supper I feared at
first they were going to be refused. We seemed to have
dissipated the romantic atmosphere of the gathering, nor
was anything said about the Dales taking a vow of secrecy,
which was, nevertheless, one of the rules of the club. I
could see Sam Geoghegan, a boy whom I had never liked,
but who was the biggest boy there, whispering to his right-hand
neighbour, and I knew he was talking about us.</p>

<p>However, as supper progressed, the atmosphere thawed
somewhat, and I began to hope things would turn out all
right. Willie Breen, who had been fumbling in his pocket,
now produced a small bottle filled with some bright red
liquid and held it up to the light, gazing at it in silence.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
Suddenly, when everybody’s attention was fixed on him,
his face stiffened into an expression of suppressed agony,
and he gasped for breath, drawing his hand across his
forehead.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, Billy? Stomach bad?” asked Sam.</p>

<p>But Willie’s eyes were closed. “If I fall down,” he
sighed in a whisper, “an’ a deadly pallor creeps over me,
force open my teeth with a knife, and pour a single drop
of this blood-red liquid down my throat——”</p>

<p>“How can you pour a drop?” interrupted Sam.</p>

<p>“Unless it is too late,” said Willie, “you will see the
colour slowly come back to my cheeks and suffuse them with
the glow of life, until at last, when you don’t expect it, I’ll
open my eyes and say, ‘Where am I?’”</p>

<p>“<em>Does</em> he have fits?” Katherine whispered.</p>

<p>“No: it’s only ‘Monte Cristo,’” I told her.</p>

<p>Katherine looked at him wonderingly, but Willie had
already his mouth crammed with bread and sardines, the
sardines she herself had brought.</p>

<p>Most of the boys now lit cigarettes, which Gerald had
given them. From the darkness below, the sound of the
sea rose up, weird and melancholy, full of an inexpressible
loneliness. The warm, ruddy light of the fire flitted across
fresh young faces. A dim fragrance seemed to be blown
down from the woods, and to mingle with the saltness of
the sea.</p>

<p>Sam Geoghegan said suddenly, “I’m a socialist.”</p>

<p>This announcement fell rather flat. The beauty of the
night had cast a vague spell upon the other members of the
club, and they were content to be silent.</p>

<p>“Do you mean like the chaps who were round last week
with the cart?” somebody asked indifferently, after a long
pause.</p>

<p>“They gave one of the wee books they had with them to
my father,” said Sam.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span></p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Willie Breen.</p>

<p>“What’s what?”</p>

<p>“A socialist.”</p>

<p>“It’s not an ‘it,’ it’s a man. It means that everybody
ought to get the same chance. There should be no privileges
nor private property nor anythin’.”</p>

<p>“But whenever you’ve got things they’re yours,” said
Willie Breen, unconvinced.</p>

<p>“You don’t have things—isn’t that what I’m saying?
Everything belongs to the State—they belong to everybody.”</p>

<p>“Socialists are always poor,” put in Sam’s chum, Robbie
McCann, unenthusiastically. “Those lads that were round
here tried to get up a collection.”</p>

<p>“Of course they’re poor,” said Sam, pityingly. “You
can’t give up every thin’ and be rich, can you? For dear
sake have a bit of wit!”</p>

<p>“Would <em>their</em> aunt have to give up her place?” asked
Willie Breen, jerking his head toward the Dales.</p>

<p>“Why wouldn’t she? Does it belong to her?”</p>

<p>This was a bold idea, and Sam accompanied it with a
glare of defiance at Gerald, from whom, nevertheless, a
minute ago he had accepted a second cigarette.</p>

<p>“Of course it belongs to her,” said Willie, wonderingly.</p>

<p>“Not rightly. Man alive, but you’re all thick in the
head. The point is that nobody has a right to anything—more’n
anybody else, I mean.”</p>

<p>“You know all about it, don’t you?” asked Gerald,
gently.</p>

<p>“I know more than you, anyway, stink-pot,” said Sam.
Two or three of the bigger boys laughed, and I began to
foresee trouble.</p>

<p>“We needn’t start a row, need we?” I suggested, amicably.</p>

<p>“I’m not startin’ a row; it was him. What call has he
to put in his jaw. He wasn’t asked to come.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span></p>

<p>“He was asked,” I replied.</p>

<p>“Ay—maybe by you—that’s nothin’.”</p>

<p>“Let’s tell stories,” Willie Breen proposed. “Do you
know how they make castor oil? There’s a woman told me
she saw it. It was a big round room, and corpses hanging
from hooks in the ceiling; and from the ends of their toes
yellow drops were falling into a basin. That was castor oil.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure. Anybody can blether you up, Billy.”</p>

<p>“I’m not saying I believe it.”</p>

<p>“It’s a wonder.”</p>

<p>Suddenly a deep, low boom rose up from the sea, as if
coming out of the infinite night, swelling, like the heavy
bass note of an organ, and dying away.</p>

<p>Katherine laid her hand on my arm. “What was that?”
she said.</p>

<p>“It’s nothing,” I murmured; but a vague sense of awe
had crept over the little group.</p>

<p>“It came last summer for the first time, didn’t it?”
asked George Edge, a boy who had not spoken before. He
had been lying on his back, looking up at the floating stars,
but he now raised himself on his elbow and looked out to
sea. He was not one of the village boys, but his people
came down every summer for two months, and I had known
him all my life. “My mother gets frightened when she
hears it,” he went on.</p>

<p>There was a pause, and then the sound came again,
floating up, weird and mysterious, as from somewhere far
out on the water. We drew closer round the fire, and
began again to talk, but the conversation had grown darker.</p>

<p>“It was here that the murder was,” said another boy,
hidden in the shadow of the rock, so that his voice seemed
a disembodied sound speaking out of the darkness.</p>

<p>“Just over there,” said George Edge.</p>

<p>“What murder?” asked Gerald.</p>

<p>The voice from the shadow spoke again. “It was a man<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
called Dewar. There was two of them comin’ home one
winter afternoon from Annalong, O’Brian and Dewar.
O’Brian had been gettin’ money, and they both had their
load of drink. It was dirty weather and no one on the
road, and maybe they fell out about somethin’. Any way,
next day they got O’Brian down below there on the stones,
his face bashed in you wouldn’t know him. Him and
Dewar were seen leavin’ Annalong together, and they got
Dewar lying drunk in his own house, and he confessed and
was hung for it.”</p>

<p>“But how did he do it?” Gerald asked.</p>

<p>“He smashed him on the face with a lump of rock, and
then threw him down into the sea. They say there are
nights when you can hear O’Brian. It’s like this.” He
gave a low wail that shrilled up to a cry.</p>

<p>“I’m goin’ home,” said Willie Breen, rising to his feet.</p>

<p>“Wee scaldy! You’ll have to go by yourself,” jeered
Sam. “And you’ll meet him as sure as death. You’ll
know him, because he won’t have any face on him, only a
lock of blood. And Dewar with him, with his neck broke.”
Sam’s head drooped horribly to his shoulder.</p>

<p>Willie Breen sat down.</p>

<p>“When you talk about ghosts or spirits it’s supposed to
bring them near,” said George Edge. “It gives them a kind
of power over you.”</p>

<p>“For goodness sake stop all that rubbish,” cried Katherine,
indignantly. “Can’t you see you’re frightening the
child out of his wits!”</p>

<p>“Go to her, baby. Hold her hand,” mocked Sam.</p>

<p>Willie turned angrily on his protectress. “I’m not
frightened. It’s you that’s frightened. You shouldn’t be
here at all. There shouldn’t be any women in the club.”</p>

<p>“Faith, he’s right there!” Sam exclaimed.</p>

<p>But George Edge, sitting up, pointed out to sea.
“Listen,” he said impressively.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span></p>

<p>We all sat still, Willie Breen with wide-open eyes. A
moment after, with a blade of grass between his thumbs,
Sam made an unearthly screech in the little boy’s ear.
It was too much, and Willie set up a howl.</p>

<p>At the same instant Katherine turned to Sam and he
received a resounding slap on his fat face. Instantly there
was tumult. Sam was on his feet, red as a turkey-cock,
blustering of all he would do if Katherine were not a girl.
Then he spied Gerald, and gave him a blow on the chest that
almost sent him into the fire. “That’s for you, you ‘get.’”</p>

<p>Gerald drew back, neither speaking, nor returning the
blow: the other boys had surrounded them. I saw Gerald’s
face, and it was very white; but he did nothing, he was
afraid. That he should be disgusted me, and at the same
time I was furious with Sam, whom, for that matter, I had
always detested. I waited just long enough to give Gerald
a chance to face him, if he wanted to; then I gave Sam a
slap with my open hand on his cheek. It was the second he
had received within two minutes, and somehow, even in the
excitement, I couldn’t help being amused.</p>

<p>We stripped to our shirts and trousers and moved out into
the moonlight. Katherine hovered in the background, but
made no attempt either to interfere or to go away. Gerald
had disappeared. I looked at Sam’s big fists. I knew he
was taller and heavier than I was, but I was not afraid of
him; instead, I had a cold determination to lick him. I
felt elated; I was glad Gerald had drawn back, since it gave
me this chance of showing Katherine what a hero I was.
We chose seconds, and there was a time-keeper, though no
one had a watch, for mine was wound up and safe under my
pillow at home. We had little science, but were mortally in
earnest.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the second round the nervous tremor
of Sam’s mouth as he stepped into the ring gave me a cruel
pleasure. I did not believe very much in his pluck, and I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
was now quite confident as to the finish. It was in the
middle of the third round, and we were both panting and
bleeding, when Michael, the policeman, appeared on the
scene, springing up as if from the bowels of the earth. How
he came to be out of bed at such an hour, and in this
particular spot, I never discovered, but he stepped in
between us and stopped the fight.</p>

<p>“Well now, this is nice goings on! Will you tell me
what it’s all about?”</p>

<p>“You go quietly to hell,” said Sam in a low voice.</p>

<p>The others chimed in. “It’s none of your business,
Michael, we’re not in the town.”</p>

<p>“Do you tell me that, now? Well, I’ll be troubling you
to go home to your beds every one of yous. This is no place
for you, Miss,” he added, having discovered Katherine in
the background, “with a lot of young rapscallions. I’ll
see you safe home.”</p>

<p>But Katherine did not move.</p>

<p>“Let them finish, Michael. Nobody’ll ever know you
were here. There’ll be no talk.”</p>

<p>Michael wavered. The presence of Katherine obviously
both troubled and puzzled him, for of course he knew who
she was. He turned to her again, but she had withdrawn
into the shadow of the rocks, whither he followed her, and
they whispered together in inaudible tones. Then he came
back. Katherine had disappeared; possibly she had
followed Gerald, who would hardly have gone very far
without her; at any rate I could not look after her now.</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose you’ll be wanting to settle this,” said
Michael, doubtfully.</p>

<p>His words were received with an outburst of cheers and
laughter. A faint greyness of dawn was already spreading
over the eastern sky. “Time!” called George Edge, and I
noticed that he had actually borrowed Michael’s big silver
watch.</p>

<p>Next morning I got a rowing up from my father. Indeed,
as soon as I saw my face in the glass, I knew it would be
quite useless to try to hide what had happened, and I told
him frankly I had been fighting. Fortunately, it was not
necessary for me to say anything about our club, nor did
I even mention Sam’s name. I simply told him that the
fight had taken place at night to prevent its being stopped,
and after that held my peace. My main feeling, in spite
of my father’s lecture, was that I was extraordinarily glad
it <em>had</em> taken place, for I had come out of it victorious, even
though I was pretty sure I had received more punishment
than I had given. My state of mind absurdly resembled
that of a young cock who gets up on a wall to crow, and
nothing my father could say had the least power to damp
my spirits. My face—especially all round my forehead and
temples—was beautifully and variously marked, yet there
was nothing I more ardently desired than that Katherine
should see me in this condition. I even felt amicably
disposed towards Gerald, who, after all, couldn’t help being
a coward. Perhaps he would come round this morning
to see how I had fared.</p>

<p>But nobody came, and in the afternoon I determined
to go up to Derryaghy. Willie Breen, who now regarded
me in the light of a hero, accompanied me. When I left
him at the lodge-gate, instead of going to the hall-door,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
I went round to the back of the house, hoping to find
Katherine on the terrace. She was not there; nobody
was there but Miss Dick, who cried out at once on seeing
my battered condition. Her tone was certainly far enough
removed from that of Willie Breen to have cooled my
conceit had such a thing been possible, but fortunately
she was too much occupied with a letter she kept folding
and unfolding to bestow any very lengthy attention on
my appearance. “My sister, Mrs. Arthur Jenkins,” she
began, not because I was worthy of her confidence, but
because there was nobody else, “wants me to go and stay
with her. I don’t know what to do. Mrs. Carroll may
not be able to spare me; though I haven’t been there for
a long time.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you ought to go,” I said easily. “Where is everybody?”
I looked round, preparatory to making my
escape. Miss Dick regarded me doubtfully.</p>

<p>“The last time I was there the youngest child had
croup. They were very anxious about him; indeed the
doctor almost gave him up; though he managed to pull
through in the end, and is quite strong now. Not that
any of them are actually what you would call robust.
They really take after Arthur, Mr. Jenkins that is, though
Sissie, that’s my sister, always says <em>he’s</em> stronger than he
looks. I’m sure I hope so, for he looks wretched. The
whole family, you know, the whole Jenkins family I mean,
are vegetarians, and vegetarians, whatever they may feel,
invariably <em>look</em> ill. When I say that to Sissie she always
gets cross, as if I could help it! But that’s what people
are like. Arthur wants to bring up the children in the
same way, which is silly, and, to my mind, trifling with
their lives. Besides, it’s so difficult when you’ve only one
maid who has to do everything: and they only give fourteen,
and what can you get for fourteen nowadays, even
in the country? You certainly can’t expect a girl like that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
to cook two dinners a day, because, you see, Sissie eats
meat.” She stopped suddenly, as if she had lost the thread
of her discourse. “We’re all going to a garden-party at
Castlewellan. I’m just waiting for the others. Except
Gerald—he won’t come. You’ll find him over there,”—she
waved her left hand. “He’s put up a hammock and
he’s been sleeping in it all day. He’s dreadfully lazy. He
won’t even practise. And though he’s so polite and
gentlemanly, I must say he’s really rather irritable: he
got quite cross at lunch. I don’t think Katherine understands
him. People with very artistic feelings, I’m sure, <em>are</em>
more easily annoyed than others. It’s not as if he were
just an ordinary person like you or me.”</p>

<p>Whether I was an ordinary person or not, I didn’t relish
being told so, even by Miss Dick, and I decided, as I had
frequently decided before, that she was a stupid creature,
and that I didn’t like her. I left her referring to the
epistle from Mrs. Arthur Jenkins, or Sissie, or whatever
she was called, and went to look for Gerald.</p>

<p>He had heard me coming, for when I found him he
had swung himself out of his hammock and was standing
beside it.</p>

<p>“Are the others gone yet?” he asked.</p>

<p>“They’re just starting. I only saw Miss Dick.”</p>

<p>“They’re going to some party, thank the Lord!”</p>

<p>“Yes; she told me.”</p>

<p>A pause followed, for I didn’t know what to say, and
he himself kept silence. What I had intended to do was
to put him at his ease, to let him know that it was all right
about last night, but my magnanimity and sympathy were
evidently quite superfluous, and I was annoyed at this.</p>

<p>We strolled back slowly to the house. “Wouldn’t it
be rather a good time to play to me?” I said. “You
promised to, and now we have the place to ourselves.”</p>

<p>“If you like.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span></p>

<p>We entered by the open window, and pulling the sofa
over beside it, I lay down in supreme laziness among a
heap of coloured cushions. Gerald went at once to the
piano.</p>

<p>“What sort of music do you care for?” he asked me.
“Or shall I just play anything?”</p>

<p>“Yes; whatever you feel in the mood for.”</p>

<p>His head was bent a little over the key-board, and he
seemed to be thinking of what he should play. I watched
a tendril of clematis that waved softly over my head, and
every now and again I breathed in the sweet scent of a
stalk of mignonette I had gathered in passing. My thoughts
floated away through the quiet afternoon, and I began
to wonder what things were like when there was no one
there to be conscious of them.</p>

<p>I know now that it was the fifteenth Prelude, but at the
time I had never even heard the name of Chopin, and all
I was aware of was that a soft, very delicate tune, was
coming to me across the room, with a curious pallor, suggestive
of the whiteness of water. I half closed my lids
and lay absolutely still. Even in my ignorance I knew
that the beauty of Gerald’s playing was extraordinary. It
may have had many faults; he may have been incapable of
doing all kinds of things that professional pianists can do;
he may have been, and probably was, deficient in power:
I do not know. He seemed to caress the notes rather than
to strike them, he seemed literally to draw the music out,
and the whole tone had a kind of liquid, singing quality,
such as I have never heard since save in the playing of
Pachmann. As I listened, the music gathered force and
sombreness, growing louder and darker in a heavily marked
crescendo, and then once more it passed into the clear soft
tune with which it had begun.</p>

<p>The sound had stopped. I said nothing; I simply
waited. The cool, pleasant summer afternoon had become<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
full of lovely voices which flickered, like waves of coloured
light, across my senses. Pensively, a little shyly even, a
simple, drooping melody breathed itself out on the air with
a strange hesitation and indecision, rising and falling, faltering,
repeating itself, resting on the “F” with a kind of
desire that gathered intensity as the note swelled and died
away, sinking back into “D.”</p>

<p>Listening to Gerald playing that sixth Nocturne, listening
to him playing all that followed it, you would have thought
he was a youth of the deepest feelings, yet I could never
find any trace of those feelings at any other time. Somewhere,
I suppose, they must have been, somewhere below
the surface, but I was never able to discover them. It
was as if his soul only came into being when he sat down
at a piano. When he played you could see him listening
to his own music, you could see him drinking it up as if it
were the perfume of my mignonette, as if there were some
finer echo audible only to himself. And his playing would
alter, would grow gayer, or a kind of weariness would creep
into it. I offer these only as the impressions I received
at the time; what I should receive now I cannot tell. Yet
I find it hard to believe I was utterly mistaken. It was
never my fortune to hear him in later years, when I had
heard many famous pianists—and I suppose I have heard
practically all those of my time—but I cannot help thinking
he might have been among the greatest had he not chosen
to be something else, something I last saw at a café in
Berlin. The puffed, horrible face, the glazed, sodden eyes—no,
there was no music there. Or if there was, it was
hidden, buried, lost for ever in that desecrated, half-paralysed
body, buried alive, like a lamp burning in a tomb.
Now, I have nothing to go upon save those first impressions
of a boyish, uncultivated taste, and the fact that in after
years the playing of Vladimir de Pachmann brought back
sharply to me the memory of that afternoon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span></p>

<p>He played on for nearly two hours. In the end he stopped
abruptly and got up from the piano, while I thanked him.
I knew that he knew he had given me a tremendous
pleasure, and there was no need to say much. He told me
the music I had been listening to was all, or nearly all, by
one composer.</p>

<p>“And that last thing?” I asked.</p>

<p>“That was one of the Studies—the one in A flat. I
can’t play anybody else. I don’t mean that other things
are more difficult, but they don’t suit me.” He was silent,
until he added, “I may as well tell you that I’m not as
good as you think.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t told you yet what I think,” I answered,
smiling, for I was still under the glamour of his mood, and
indeed at that moment I could have hugged him. I did
not want to talk of ordinary things. The music had
wakened in me a feeling of melancholy, like a memory of
some delicious thing that had happened long ago, and
would never happen again.</p>

<p>I tried to explain my very tenuous ideas to Gerald, but
they did not interest him. And already I felt our relation
altering. When he was at the piano he had seemed to me
a kind of angel; now that other element, that element
of latent antagonism, was beginning to re-awaken in me.</p>

<p>Tea had meanwhile been laid for us upon the terrace.
Tony, who had been asleep outside in the sun, threw off
drowsiness like an outworn garment, and sat up beside my
chair, with raised head, and beautiful, dark eyes that watched
every movement I made, especially those which happened
to convey a piece of bread and butter or cake into my
mouth. When I looked at him he instantly gave half a
dozen quick wags of his tail, and then resumed his former
attitude of motionless expectation, to which attention was
attracted by a variety of queer little highly expressive
noises he produced from somewhere in his throat. Nobody<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
being there to prevent me, I gave him about half the cake,
piece by piece, each of which he swallowed almost whole,
and with a wag of the tail to show how he appreciated
this delicate pastime.</p>

<p>“Did you get much hurt last night?” Gerald asked me
suddenly.</p>

<p>The question was unexpected, for I looked upon the
whole incident as closed. I glanced up from feeding Tony.
“No; not much,” I answered.</p>

<p>“And the other—I forget his name—Sam something?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Sam’s all right.”</p>

<p>“Do you think I should have fought him?”</p>

<p>“One was enough,” I said carelessly.</p>

<p>“Did you think I was afraid?”</p>

<p>I looked away. His question seemed somehow to be all
wrong. “I didn’t think about it,” I answered, after a
slight pause.</p>

<p>“It must have looked as if I were afraid,” he went on.
“I thought so afterwards.”</p>

<p>I couldn’t imagine what he was trying to get at. I
wanted to stop him talking like this. It was even less to
my taste than his funking Sam last night had been.</p>

<p>“Are you working at anything besides music?” I asked
him, jerkily.</p>

<p>He shook his head. “Not very much. I have a tutor.
Why won’t you talk about last night?”</p>

<p>“What is there to talk about? I’m sorry it turned out
that way, but I can’t help it, though of course it was my
fault for taking you without letting the others know. I
should have told them beforehand.”</p>

<p>“I’m not afraid of that lout, anyway. If I see him
again——”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, what’s the use of worrying about it?” I
interrupted, disgusted with his persistence.</p>

<p>The pause that followed was an uncomfortable one. If<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
he had deliberately tried to efface the impression his music
had made upon me he could not have succeeded better.</p>

<p>He gave a strange little laugh. “I see you don’t believe
me.”</p>

<p>“No: I don’t believe you,” I answered bluntly, “and
I don’t know why you should want me to.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you think it is pleasant to be taken for a
coward?”</p>

<p>“I’m sure it isn’t pleasant; but I can’t imagine that
it matters greatly to you what I think.”</p>

<p>“Of course, if I hadn’t done what I did, you wouldn’t
have had <em>your</em> particular little swagger!”</p>

<p>“Isn’t that rather a rotten sort of thing to say?” I
answered as I got up. “I think I’ll move on. Come,
Tony.”</p>

<p>Gerald began to apologize.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s all right,” I said, coldly, leaving him there.</p>

</div>


<p>Katherine, who had promised to sit to me for her portrait,
kept putting me off from day to day, and it was nearly a
week later when I made my first attempt. By some happy
chance on that particular afternoon I had found her alone,
for as a rule Gerald was there, and even now it was almost
as if he were with us, since she began at once to talk about
him.</p>

<p>“You must take off your hat,” I said, ignoring her
remarks.</p>

<p>She obeyed me, and I began to draw in my outline.</p>

<p>“Gerald likes you,” she said. “I wish you would be
friends with him.”</p>

<p>“But I am friends with him,” I answered, abstractedly.</p>

<p>“Not very much. You would rather he was not with
us.”</p>

<p>“That doesn’t mean I’m not friends with him.”</p>

<p>“He has so few friends,” she went on, still clinging to the
subject.</p>

<p>“Has he? I’m afraid, no matter how much I tried, we
could never really be chums.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“I don’t understand him.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you understand him?”</p>

<p>“I suppose because I’m stupid. Besides, what I do
understand I don’t greatly like.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span></p>

<p>She was not offended; she simply asked, “What is the
matter with him?”</p>

<p>I feared I had been horribly rude, but the words had
slipped out before I could check them. “There is nothing
the matter with him,” I answered hastily. “I wasn’t
thinking of what I was saying. It is only that—that
we’re not suited to each other: we’re too different. At all
events, it is of very little importance, seeing that you’re
going away in a few days.”</p>

<p>“We’ll be back again next year, I expect. Aunt Clara
wants me to come. <em>She</em> isn’t very friendly to Gerald either.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you only fancy that; of course she is. And there’s
Miss Dick, who worships the very ground he walks on.”</p>

<p>“Miss Dick’s too silly for anything.”</p>

<p>“There you are! And yet you want me to worship him
too!”</p>

<p>“I don’t want anything of the kind; and you know
that. But of course if you don’t like him I can’t make
you. I think that night—the night we went with you to
your meeting—has something to do with it.”</p>

<p>“Oh that!” I answered lightly. It seemed to me a long
time ago, though there was a yellow bruise still visible above
my left eyebrow.</p>

<p>I finished my outline and began to paint. The other
picture had been painted indoors, I reflected. I don’t
know what made me think of it, but I couldn’t get it out
of my mind. It kept floating between me and my work,
and I seemed to see it quite as clearly as I saw Katherine
herself. Still I persevered, though my progress was slow
and from the beginning unsatisfactory. I talked to
Katherine, or rather I replied to her, for what she said
penetrated only the fringe of my consciousness. She had
brought a book out with her, and by and by she began to
read aloud, but I have no idea what it was she read. I
painted away most diligently, yet all the time I couldn’t<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
get rid of a foolish impression that I was being watched.
And this fancy, utterly absurd if you like, took possession
of me, grew stronger and stronger, till it seemed to tremble
on the verge of reality.</p>

<p>“What are you looking at?” Katherine asked me suddenly,
having reached, I suppose, the end of a chapter or a
story.</p>

<p>“Nothing,” I answered guiltily.</p>

<p>But she wheeled round in her chair, and stared back at
the house. I dipped my brush in water, and remarked
quite quietly, “It’s only that I thought I saw someone at
the window—the third window from the left, upstairs.”</p>

<p>Katherine shaded her eyes with her hand. “I can’t see
anybody: the sun catches the glass. It must be one of
the maids, for there’s nobody else in.” She yawned and
took up the book again. “If it <em>is</em> one of the maids,” she
added, “she might have had sufficient sense to bring us
out tea. I’ve been simply dying for some for the last half-hour,
only I didn’t like to disturb you.”</p>

<p>“She hasn’t been there half an hour,” I replied. “I’ll
go and tell them. Promise you won’t look at what I’ve
done while I’m away: it isn’t finished.”</p>

<p>“All right. I must see it when it <em>is</em> though: you’re not
to tear it up or anything.”</p>

<p>“No, of course not.”</p>

<p>I walked back to the house, and not till I was quite close
did I glance up at the windows above me. Naturally there
was nothing. I hesitated in the hall. Had I been really
sincere in thinking I had seen anything or not? I couldn’t
be quite sure, for there was no doubt I often deliberately
gave my imagination a kind of push in a certain definite
direction, started it off, as it were, and then left it to perform
all kinds of antics. Before me lay the broad, low staircase.
Should I go up? I leaned against the balusters and
listened, gazing aloft into the cool shadow. Suddenly I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
heard a door open near the kitchen, then the rustle of a
dress, and one of the servants appeared. I told her that
Miss Dale would like tea brought outside, and went into
the morning-room myself for a small folding-table, which
I carried back with me.</p>

<p>I looked again at my drawing. “Tea will be here in a
minute or two,” I said. Then I handed the drawing to
Katherine, for it was a failure, and there was no use going
on with it.</p>

<p>“Don’t hold it so close to you,” I cried, and Katherine
obediently stretched out her arm full length.</p>

<p>“I think it’s quite good, you know, if it wasn’t meant to
be my portrait,—but it’s no more like me than Adam.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be so rude. Of course it’s like you.”</p>

<p>A servant appeared with a tea-tray, and as soon as she
was gone I seated myself on the grass at Katherine’s feet.
When I had finished tea and had handed her back my empty
cup I still sat there.</p>

<p>“Do you see that strip of yellow sand down below? It
always reminds me of a certain poem.”</p>

<p>I knew Katherine was not fond of poetry; she had told
me so herself; but I repeated the verses aloud for my own
pleasure, in a sort of sing-song, laying tremendous stress
on the rhymes.</p>

<div class="poetry">

    <div class="verse indent0">“It was many and many a year ago,</div>

  </div>
</div>

<p>I looked up at Katherine and saw that she was smiling.
“It was written about this place,” I declared, “about just
that strip of yellow sand and that blue sea.”</p>

<p>“And about just this little boy,” said Katherine, stroking
my hair back from my forehead.</p>

<p>“Just this little boy,” I answered, narrowing my eyes
under her touch, “whom you think such a very little boy
indeed.”</p>

<p>“Such a dear little boy,” murmured Katherine, lulling
me with her voice, and all the time stroking my hair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span></p>

<p>“Is he dear?” I asked eagerly.</p>

<p>“I think so.”</p>

<p>“And you like him?”</p>

<p>“I like him very much.”</p>

<p>“How much? What do you like about him?”</p>

<p>She laughed. “I like everything about him?”</p>

<p>“But what?”</p>

<p>“The way he is: the way he looks: the way he pouts
when he is cross: the kind of things he says: the way he
asks questions: even the way he hesitates before some
letters, so that you can see what he is going to say in his
eyes before he can get it out.”</p>

<p>I was intensely happy. I leaned back my head, and
Katherine’s dark blue eyes looked straight down into mine.
I could see nothing but that clear dark blue which seemed
to shut me out from the world, yet I knew she was smiling.
Then she bent lower and her lips lightly touched my forehead.</p>

<p>Almost at the same moment I heard the swish of petticoats
rustling over the grass from behind. I sat up straight,
but did not look round till the rattle of tea-cups had ceased,
and the servant who was bearing them off had almost
reached the house.</p>

<p>“Gracious! I hope she didn’t see me kissing you!”
said Katherine, half-laughing.</p>

<p>“What matter?”</p>

<p>“Of course it matters; and it’s your fault too, for
pretending to be a little boy and all that nonsense. I’m
sure she’s telling the cook about it at this moment. <em>She</em>
doesn’t think you’re a little boy. Get up at once.”</p>

<p>I knew Katherine wasn’t really much perturbed, but I
got up and began to put away my colours, and we went back
to the house. I left my painting materials on the window-sill,
and, having made Katherine a present of my drawing,
we strolled down to the shore. As we walked along the
hard sand by the edge of the sea I wanted to tell her how<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
much I cared for her. It was an admirable opportunity,
and, if I could only get the first plunge over, I knew it would
be all right. But I couldn’t. White sea-gulls were swooping
and wheeling over the dark blue water, calling their
peculiar lonely cry, and the foam of the waves was white as
snow. “I <em>will</em> tell her: I <em>will</em> tell her,” I kept repeating
to my soul; and all the time I maintained a most discreet
silence on the subject, and babbled instead of the regatta
that would take place on Saturday, and of the chance of a
fine day. I had entered for two swimming-races and a
diving-competition, and Katherine was coming to see me.
I kept on talking about this, though I knew very well everything
would happen exactly as it had happened last year;
that in the swimming-races George Edge would be first and
I should be second, and that I should win the diving-competition;
and moreover I didn’t in the least care just then
whether the regatta took place or not.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact I didn’t win the diving-competition;
I wasn’t even second; and my defeat was brought about
simply by my own exceeding eagerness to show off.</p>

<p>On that Saturday the village was a holiday village. The
men and boys perspired freely under heavy, ugly, Sunday
clothes, and the women and girls were decked out in all
kinds of finery—bright dresses, trinkets, ribbons, and cheap
but brilliant hats. Why was it, I wondered, that all these
fine garments should have been chosen apparently for a
mysterious property they had of bringing out in the appearance
of their wearers a coarseness I never noticed on ordinary
occasions? Sam Geoghegan’s salmon-pink tie, Mr. McCann’s
fancy waistcoat, the peacock-blue dress of Annie Breen,
with its white lace collar—these were things positively
bewildering, if one realized that they represented the actual
taste of the persons they adorned.</p>

<p>Every year the same programme was followed. In the
morning the water-races—boat-races and swimming-races—took
place; in the afternoon there were sports—foot-races,
tugs-of-war, wrestling—held in one of Mrs. Carroll’s fields.</p>

<p>I drifted about in the crowd with a group of boys. Our
swimming-races came off fairly early, but I was only third
in each, and George Edge second, for a youth, whom neither
of us had ever seen or heard of before, turned up and carried
off both first prizes. This made me anxious about the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
diving-competition, which he had also entered for. We
were to go in off the end of the pier, where a platform with
a spring-board had been erected for us. Then, when we
had dived, we swam round to the ladder and climbed up
to take our turn again. It was the last event but one of
the morning’s programme, and had always been the most
popular. When the hour for it came round, having learned
in the meantime from some of the spectators that the
victorious stranger was a poor diver, I had regained
confidence, and, as the crowd drew in closer to watch us,
I was fully prepared to show them what was what. As
a matter of fact, my first two dives were all right, but, before
my third and last, I caught sight of Katherine standing
quite close to me, and the result of this was that I determined
to excel anything ever seen. I took a tremendous
race the full length of the platform, but, just at the end of
the spring-board, my foot slipped and I sprawled in flat on
my belly. The shock knocked all the wind out of me, and
the smack I gave the water could have been heard half a
mile away. It was extremely painful, and it put me out
of the competition; yet when I clambered up the iron ladder
I was greeted by volleys of laughter and humorous remarks.
My accident, indeed, appeared to be by far the most enjoyable
event of the morning. It did not seem to occur to
anybody, except one of the stewards, that I might be badly
hurt, and him, when he came to ask me if I were all right,
I sent about his business. I put on my overcoat and went
to the dressing-shed in a furious temper.</p>

<p>The field where the sports took place lay about a mile
out of the village. Mrs. Carroll and some other ladies were
dispensing refreshments to all comers, and afterwards the
prizes would be given out. I went up to Derryaghy to
call for Katherine and Gerald, to go with them, but found
they were going to ride over, and were all ready to start
when I arrived. It was the first time I had seen Katherine<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
on horseback, and she looked to me more beautiful than
ever. In her dark-blue riding-habit, with her sparkling
eyes and rosy cheeks, her radiant youth and health, she
made me think of the girl in the equestrian portrait by
Millais and Landseer, a coloured reproduction of which I
had cut out of a Christmas number and tacked up on the
wall in my bedroom. And straightway I saw in myself
the page-boy who stands by the gateway in that picture,
his eyes fixed in rapt admiration upon his mistress. They
rode away, an amazingly handsome pair, telling me they
would see me later up at the field, and to this I answered,
“Yes.” Mrs. Carroll and Miss Dick had already gone on
in the carriage, so I was left quite alone. I decided immediately
that I wouldn’t go to the sports: if they chose
to leave me like this I wasn’t going to run after them. I
mooned about, building a romance on the equestrian portrait
<em>motif</em>. I imagined myself as dying; some accident
had happened to me, and suddenly Katherine rode up and
springing down from her horse threw her arms round me,
kneeling in the blood and dust of the road. She kissed me
passionately, careless of all the people who watched her,
repeating again and again, “I love you—I love you—I love
you.”</p>

<p>I gloated over this imaginary scene till I had squeezed the
last drop of colour out of it, and it ceased, by dint of much
repetition, to thrill me even faintly: then I went into the
house and nosed about for a book. A dozen had just come
down from the library in town, and, with a couple of volumes
of “Two on a Tower” under my arm, I made my way to the
shore.</p>

<p>Gradually, in the warmth of the sunlight, I grew drowsy,
and the beautiful, breaking sea, and the harsh crying of the
gulls, soothed me and seemed to build up an enchanted
world about me, where I was shut in with the romance of
the tale I was reading. By and by, after perhaps two hours,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
I closed my book, though still keeping my finger in the place.
I reflected that nobody up at the field had spent such an
afternoon as I had spent, and I compared my spiritual
pleasure with their rough commonplace pleasures, and the
extraordinary superiority of my soul became immediately
apparent. Then my thoughts turned to the story I had
been reading. My sympathies were entirely enlisted by
Lady Constantine and her youthful astronomer, but particularly
by Lady Constantine. Even the fact that she was so
much older than her lover appealed to me. Her gentleness;
her intense femininity; her dark eyes; the softness
of her skin; the perfume of her hair; and the delight of her
caresses—these were present to me vividly, almost physically,
and I rejoiced in the love-scenes in the tower with a
frank and innocent sensuality, filling in the picture, where
it was blurred or vague, from my own imaginings.</p>

</div>


<p>During that last week of August, after the Dales had left,
“I wandered lonely as a cloud.” Up to the eve of their
departure I had been happier than I had ever been in my
life, but as soon as they were gone I became a prey to sentimental
regret. If Katherine had cared for me as I cared for
her I might have found more comfort; but she didn’t, and
I was perfectly aware of the fact. Mingled with it all was
an increasing dread of the new existence I already saw
opening out before me. I distrusted it: I had, indeed,
that instinctive distrust of life itself, which contemplates
anything unknown with uneasiness, and clings with passion
to familiar faces and things.</p>

<p>When the day of my departure, a Saturday, came round,
and I saw my box all corded and ready in the hall, I felt
extremely depressed. Now that I had said good-bye to
Mrs. Carroll it was as if I had cut myself completely adrift
from the past, and yet I believe I should have been willing
to go had I not been going to the McAllisters. The McAllisters
were our relations; the only ones I knew of. Aunt
Margaret was my father’s sister, and her husband kept a
shop in a street called Cromac Street. I had never been
to their house, but they had been down a good many times
to visit us, and I did not care for them. There were four
children, and I disliked them all, except George, the eldest;
and I disliked Aunt Margaret in particular; while to Uncle<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
George I was indifferent, seeing that he did not very much
count one way or the other. But to live with them!...</p>

<p>Mrs. Carroll had wanted to send me to a school in England,
but my father would not permit this. He had an idea, and
nothing would ever shake it, that English public schools
were dens of iniquity. This he had gathered from some
article that had appeared in a review, and from the story
“Eric.” I suppose he thought I should fall a particularly
easy victim to the temptations I might be submitted to;
take, like the boys in “Eric,” to drink, “little by little,” or
even quite rapidly; come home disgraced; at any rate
he would not run the risk, when, by sending me to the
McAllisters, he could provide me with the “influence of a
religious home.” For Uncle George was religious, and so was
Aunt Margaret; and so, I supposed, were the children—George,
at least, I had been told, was a communicant—and it
was the thought of all this that now lay heavy on my soul.</p>

<p>I was not to go up to town till the afternoon, and as we
sat down to our early dinner I could not, though I knew it
was absolutely useless, refrain from again taking up the
tabooed subject. I suggested how much better it would be
for me to go into lodgings of my own choosing. If they
were more expensive, Mrs. Carroll would not mind. “Whether
she would mind or not,” my father answered, “I should
have thought you would not have wanted to put her to any
unnecessary expense.”</p>

<p>“But she wouldn’t mind doing it,” I repeated, obstinately.
“She told you she wanted to.”</p>

<p>“You know very well that is not the question,” my
father said, more coldly. “I have explained why I think
it better that you should be with those who will look after
you. You are not old enough to be by yourself.”</p>

<p>“I don’t like the McAllisters,” I answered, sullenly.</p>

<p>My father looked annoyed. “Perhaps you think they
are not good enough for you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span></p>

<p>“They certainly aren’t,” I replied.</p>

<p>It was a pity that our last meal together should have been
somewhat embittered by these remarks, but it was not altogether
my fault. For my father had been too extreme in
his measures. Under the impression that what I needed was
to get into surroundings which would more or less counteract
the supposed relaxing influence of Mrs. Carroll’s indulgence,
he had arranged that I was not even to come home for weekends,
but was to submit myself during the entire term to the
bracing effect of the McAllister family.</p>

<p>No more was said upon the subject, and my father gave
me after dinner a little book, called “Daily Light,” which
I promised to read every night and morning. He came to
the station to see me off, and, as we were far too early, he
was obliged to stand for a quarter of an hour at the window
of the carriage, while I longed for the train to start, and we
both tried hard to find something to say. I was tormented
by an uncertainty as to whether he would expect me to kiss
him when I said good-bye. At the sound of the guard’s
whistle I thrust out my hand. We shook hands; that was
all; and, with the train beginning to move out of the station,
I sat back in the corner of the empty third-class carriage.</p>

<p>I had a sense of leaving everything behind me, as if I had
been starting for the world’s end; and, curiously enough, as
much as, or more than, by any human face, I was haunted
by a vision of the house. I had forsaken it, and I felt its
low, faint call coming to me through the rain. I could see
the silent, closed rooms upstairs, the long passage with its
rows of brown portraits and the tall window at the end, and
it was as if a dust were dropping down upon these things,
covering them to sleep till I should return. The shadowy
ghosts slipped back into their picture-frames; gradually the
life died out of their eyes; and a cold, unbroken silence, like
the chill of death, closed over all that hidden under-world.
Outside the apples had begun to redden on the high brick<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
walls of the fruit-garden, but within the house all was frozen
and lifeless. They were my spirits, my ghosts, and could
live only while I loved them. I loved them still, but I was
too far away, and I might not find them when I came back.</p>

<p>The landscape gliding past me showed through a fine,
grayish mist. It was cold, and I pulled up the windows, which
almost immediately became covered with the same mist that
drifted in the air outside. I wondered where Katherine was,
and what she was doing. I had not heard from her, though
I had written twice. Then I lay back in my uncomfortable
corner and tried to think of nothing.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
</div>


<p>At the other end I was met by my cousin George, a big,
red-haired hobbledehoy of seventeen, with a curiously small
face, bright brown eyes with a reddish light in them, and a
freckled skin. George, I remembered, used to be amusing,
and when I saw him standing on the platform my spirits
rose a little. He proposed that I should send on my luggage,
and that we ourselves should walk, as he wanted to make a
call on the way. When we had arranged this we set out.
I had not been so frequently in Belfast that I did not take an
interest in the streets. Just now, it being Saturday afternoon,
they were full of people, and at the end of the Queen’s
Bridge some kind of noisy meeting—religious or political—was
in full swing, but we did not stop to listen. Presently
we turned to our left into a long straight street lined with
unattractive, unprosperous-looking shops, and so narrow
that in one place there was not room for two trams to pass.
There was a liberal sprinkling of public-houses, of cheap
clothiers and greengrocers, while here and there the gilded
sign of a pawnbroker hung out over the greasy pavement. I
was about to ask why we had chosen such a disagreeable
route, when George touched my arm and said cheerfully,
“Here we are.”</p>

<p>“Here!” I echoed, with involuntary dismay. “But——”</p>

<p>“We live over the shop,” George explained. He had
noticed my surprise, however, and had coloured.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span></p>

<p>I pretended to have been only astonished that we had
reached our journey’s end so quickly, but I don’t know that
George was deceived. Inwardly I was furious with my
father for arranging for me to come to live in such a place,
with a public lavatory hardly ten yards away, and facing the
windows. The crowded street, the mean, dingy houses, the
mean, dingy people, the noise and rattle of innumerable
trams: it was all disgusting, even beyond my expectations!
And I was to live here! I simply wouldn’t do it.</p>

<p>“We haven’t been here very long,” George continued.
“We used to be round in Shaftesbury Square.” Then, as
I stood motionless on the pavement, “Aren’t you coming
in?”</p>

<p>I followed him into the shop in silence. As he pushed
open the door a bell answered with a clear, decisive ping.
There was a shop on either side of the passage—one stocked
with pipes, tobacco, cigarettes, and sweets; the other with
newspapers, stationery, and cheap editions of books in
hideous paper bindings. In the tobacco department there
was nobody; in the stationery department a girl was
moving about, fixing things. She turned round on our
entrance and George introduced me: “My cousin, Mr.
Peter Waring, Miss Izzy.”</p>

<p>Miss Izzy and I shook hands. She smiled brightly upon
me and hoped I was in good health. She evidently knew
all about me, and had no need of George’s introduction. I
observed that she had a lot of glossy, brown hair, which she
wore twisted up in a coil on the top of her head in a way I
had never seen hair arranged before, and which was kept in
its place by long things like skewers, with large coloured
balls at their ends. She wore a pince-nez, and was neatly
dressed in dark blue, with a white linen collar and white
cuffs, rather mannish in type. It was very plain to me that
Miss Izzy had a great deal of style. She had also good
features, but her femininity had been slightly eclipsed by a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
tremendous air of business efficiency, and by the severity of
her pince-nez. I had never yet seen anybody nearly so
business-like as Miss Izzy looked, and if I had been an
employer of labour I should have engaged her as manager
at a large salary on the spot. Through the open door there
came the shrill angry voices of small boys playing football in
an alley at the side of the house. There was a squabble in
progress, a cross-fire of abusive language suddenly broken
by cries of, “Start a new match—Start a new match.”</p>

<p>George was standing against the counter, and had begun
to pick his teeth with a pin extracted from the bottom of his
waistcoat. Miss Izzy went back to her task of arranging a
pile of new books, evidently just come in. She was working
out an elaborate pattern with their pictured covers, and as
she did so she read the titles aloud. “‘The Hour of Vengeance,’”
she proclaimed. “‘In Love’s Sweet Bondage,’”
she added, more dreamily. “‘The Clue of the Broken
Ruby’; ‘Cynthia Cyrilhurst’—it’s well for people that have
names like that!”</p>

<p>“I don’t think much of it,” said George.</p>

<p>Miss Izzy sighed, “It’s better than some, any way.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you like your own name?” I ventured.</p>

<p>“My Christian name’s all right. But there’s no use being
called Althea, if it isn’t going to be backed up by anything!
Althea Izzy is neither one thing nor another.”</p>

<p>“You can easily remedy that!” declared George, gallantly,
from the midst of his dental experiments.</p>

<p>Miss Izzy scrutinised him. “It wouldn’t be McAllister
that would do it,” she said.</p>

<p>But George continued placidly to attend to his teeth. “I
hear Miss Johnson’s getting married at eight o’clock next
Friday,” he remarked.</p>

<p>Miss Izzy bounced round, knocking over a box of note-paper.
“How do <em>you</em> know?” she demanded, glaring at
him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, I just heard,” said George, calmly. He carefully
inspected the pin before returning it to his waistcoat.</p>

<p>“‘Just heard!’—through the key-hole, I suppose. It
strikes me you ‘just hear’ a deal you’re not meant to. And
they don’t want it talked about—mind that!”</p>

<p>“Why don’t they want it talked about,” I asked.</p>

<p>“Because they want a quiet wedding. She’s in a bakery,
and he’s a clerk in Nicholl’s, and, if it got out, the church
would be full.”</p>

<p>The conversation was at this point interrupted by the
entrance of Uncle George, who appeared in the doorway,
coming in from the street. He was a quiet, gray little man,
and his movements always reminded me of those of a small
dog in a strange room, wandering about, sniffing furtively
at the legs of chairs and tables. He was timid, and when
he spoke to you he rubbed his hands together with an affectation
of cheerfulness that was directly contradicted by his
dark, melancholy eyes. He had always struck me as being
kind in his intentions, and I regretted that they had seemed
to count for so little when opposed to Aunt Margaret’s.
Uncle George was afraid of Aunt Margaret. He had an air
of assuming that there was perfect harmony between them,
but I had noticed that he rarely made a remark in her
presence without glancing at her to see how she would take
it. He reminded me of one of those old photographs one
discovers at the backs of frames, their features almost
obliterated from long exposure. His whole face, indeed, in
its pale irregularity, had a suggestion of vagueness, as if it
had been softly sponged over. His manner too—there was
something in it which seemed to blur, to rub out, the impression
of everything he said. His mind was lit by a kind
of twilight in which the outlines of things were lost, in which
opposites ceased to be contradictory, and impossibilities
found a friendly shelter. And this twilight was reflected in
his eyes, in their vague credulity, in the mildness of his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
glance, which peeped out innocently from under ridiculously
fierce and bushy eyebrows. I knew Uncle George had
failed in his business some years ago, and it was difficult to
believe that he could ever be successful. His interest was
not primarily in such things, but in the church, where he was
a more perpetual figure than the minister, and in the church
meetings, which he never missed, and which he sometimes
even got up. I rather liked him; there was something
about him that made it easy to talk to him; and though he
was desperately religious, and held the same severe doctrines
as my father, his nature was so little aggressive that in
practice he was the most kindly and human creature in the
world.</p>

<p>“How are you?” he asked, shaking my hand. “We’re
very glad to see you. How’s your father?” His left eye
twitched slightly while he talked, giving him a comical
appearance of winking very knowingly.</p>

<p>“Quite well, thank you,” I answered.</p>

<p>“Haven’t you been upstairs yet? Haven’t you seen
your Aunt Margaret? Why didn’t you take him to see
mother, George? Well, come along now, it’s time for tea.
I think you might leave the shop, Miss Izzy, and come too—a
special occasion, you know, a special occasion!” he laughed
and patted me on the shoulder.</p>

<p>“Thanks, I’ve had my tea already,” Miss Izzy returned,
without enthusiasm. “And you’re having yours upstairs
to-night,” she added, somewhat tartly, seeing him move in
the wrong direction.</p>

<p>“Oh! In the parlour; in honour of this young man; a
special occasion, a special occasion!” He repeated his
pleasantry, chuckling softly and rubbing his hands, while it
was all I could do to keep from returning his friendly and
unconscious wink.</p>

<p>“I’d rather stay here than run up and down stairs every
time the bell rings,” Miss Izzy continued, the invitation to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
tea evidently rankling in her mind. From behind his father’s
back George blew a kiss to her.</p>

<p>Aunt Margaret welcomed me without effusion. She was
an enormous woman, dark, middle-aged, and with a peculiar
smile that always made me feel uneasy. Her lips parted
and her teeth became visible, but otherwise her face underwent
no change, the expression in her hard, shining, black
eyes did not alter. It was, somehow, not a smile at all, but a
grimace, and disappeared with a startling suddenness, leaving
no trace behind it. When her face was at rest, her lips drew
in, as if by some mysterious suction. She wore a wig,
and it was this I think that helped to make her look peculiar,
and even slightly uncanny. I had been told that she suffered
from some obscure, internal disease, which at times caused
her great pain, but though she was white and fat and puffy,
she presented no appearance of being an invalid. As she
kissed me, a ceremony I would gladly have dispensed with,
I became conscious of a vague, sickly odour, reminding me
of the smell of a chemist’s shop.</p>

<p>Uncle George asked her if tea would soon be ready, but
she gave him no answer; she only smiled in her strange
fashion, and began to question me about my father and my
journey—one would have thought I had been travelling all
day. Two small boys held her by her voluminous skirts,
my cousins, Gordon and Thomas. They were about six or
seven, I suppose, and singularly unattractive, the kind of
children who have perpetual colds and are never provided
with an adequate supply of pocket-handkerchiefs.</p>

<p>I shook hands with Gordon and Thomas; I really couldn’t
do anything more; but their mother noticed my omission,
for they had raised damp, red-nosed, little faces to be kissed,
and though she only smiled again, I was convinced that
already she had taken a dislike to me. Possibly her dislike
dated back to an earlier period than our present meeting,
but, with a boy’s subtle instinct, I was certain of its existence.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
Just then the door opened and another child entered the
room. This was Alice, a little girl of ten. She completed
the family, though there had been several others, who had
died in infancy. Alice I did not kiss either. Looking up, I
saw my aunt’s hard black eyes fixed upon me. I gave her
back stare for stare, without flinching, and she turned away,
with that curious, grimacing smile I now hated.</p>

<p>Alice herself did not appear to resent my coldness; she
hung on to my arm and laughed up at me as if we were the
oldest friends in the world. She was a strange, elf-like
child, with a pale face and big black eyes that were not hard
like her mother’s. She looked as if she had been allowed
all her life to sit up too late. She was small for her
age, and extraordinarily fragile; she was like a little figure
cut out of a Sime drawing.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Uncle George, who had been out in the rain,
and had removed his boots, was sitting before the gas-stove,
presenting the soles of two large, gray-socked feet to the red
bars. A light steam began to rise from them, and Uncle
George declared that his new boots must “let in,” and that
he had a good mind to take them back to the man he had
bought them from, and that it was too bad. I sat down near
him and talked to him, while I watched the steam float up
from his feet. Aunt Margaret was getting tea ready in
another room, and little Alice hovered behind my chair.
Every now and again she leaned over the back of it and said
something. She brought a book to show me, and while
I looked at it she put her arms round my neck and kissed my
cheek.</p>

<p>“Run away, Alice, and quit bothering Peter,” said Uncle
George. “It’s queer the way she’s taken to you,” he added
in a gratified whisper. “She’s usually that shy you couldn’t
coax her out of a corner!” Alice retreated, but almost
immediately came back, and again put her arms round me.
She held her small white face close to mine and looked at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
me with her great black eyes and smiled. She gave me
an impression of a little house haunted by queer and not
altogether pleasant ghosts, and yet somehow I felt sorry
for her, and I stroked her thin hand that rested on my
sleeve, delicate and light as a leaf.</p>

<p>“You’re a lovely big boy,” she whispered in my ear,
rubbing her face up and down against my jacket, as if it
had been the fur of an animal.</p>

<p>I couldn’t help laughing, and she cuddled close against
me, her chin on my shoulder. “She must be awfully
nervous,” I thought, for the thunderous approach of one
of those hideous traction-engines, that I was soon to find
were a feature of the town, made her tremble.</p>

<p>When we sat down to tea Alice insisted on sitting beside
me. I had an idea, possibly suggested by Miss Izzy’s
words, that the room we were in was not often used. I
hoped it wasn’t, for it was stuffy and uncomfortable, and
so small that you felt everywhere beneath the table the
warm proximity of other people’s limbs. I hated being
cramped in this way; it seemed to me that all the time
I was breathing other people’s breaths, and once I got this
notion into my head I couldn’t forget it. The furniture
was cheap, flimsy, and uncomfortable. The curtains, the
gaudy vases, the hideous wall-paper, were of the brightest
and least accordant colours, and I even preferred our parlour
at home, where, if the things were not less ugly, there
were fewer of them. Several pictures hung on the walls,
and one hung directly in front of me. It was an engraving,
and represented a young man in armour visibly torn between
a desire for virtue, embodied in a flaxen-haired lady in
floating white drapery, and a deplorable weakness for all
that another lady might be taken as symbolising. This
latter person was a brunette, and rather more scantily,
though quite decently, draped. She held a glass of champagne
in her hand, waving it triumphantly aloft, like a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
torch. I confess that the work fascinated me, for it was
my first acquaintance with the type of art it represented.</p>

<p>“A fine picture,” murmured Uncle George, seeing me
gazing at it. “It’s a Royal Academy picture that!”</p>

<p>I said nothing. I did not know what a Royal Academy
picture was, nor did I admire this example. It was not
so much that the figures looked like unsuccessful waxworks,
as that the banality of the moral irritated me. It was the
first time I had ever seen art of this extremely ethical
character, and in its spirit it reminded me of my old friends
in the “Golden Ladder Series.”</p>

<p>I hoped tea would not last much longer. In the small
room, the large yellow slices of an extremely odoriferous
cheese made the atmosphere heavy and unpleasant. Moreover,
when this cheese was offered to me with hard,
pink, sugared biscuits, I didn’t quite know what to do.
I had refused several things already, and I knew Aunt
Margaret thought I was turning up my nose at the food
provided for me, and provided specially, I could guess,
from the behaviour of the others, because it was my first
night. So I accepted the cheese and sugared biscuits, and
struggled through them.</p>

<p>After tea George asked if we were going to have “worship”
now or later? We had it “now,” and as soon as
we rose from our knees he suggested that we should “go
out for a bit.”</p>

<p>“Where are you going to?” Aunt Margaret inquired.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know: up the street just. We can’t sit
in the house all the evenin’. It’s quite fine now.”</p>

<p>I was nothing loath, and clattered down the stairs after
him. As soon as we were outside George’s uncertainty as
to our destination appeared to vanish. “Did you ever
see a boxing match?” he asked.</p>

<p>“A boxing match?”</p>

<p>“A fight—a prize-fight—whatever you like to call it.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
Come on an’ we’ll go to the Comet, only for the Lord’s
sake don’t say anythin’ about it at home!”</p>

<p>“Are you not allowed to go?”</p>

<p>“Allowed! Wait till you know them a bit better. The
boss’s idea of an enjoyable evenin’ is some Sankey and
Moody touch.”</p>

<p>We turned down a side street, and then another and
another, till I completely lost my bearings; but very soon
George said, “There it is, Coxy. You’re goin’ to see a bit
of life, eh?” and pointed to a small theatre at the opposite
side of the road. Above the entrance, a round purplish
globe threw down a pool of light on the dirty pavement.
A number of men and youths in caps, and with mufflers
round their necks, hung about the door, talking and spitting,
and at the corner some small boys looked on. George
pushed boldly in and I followed. We took tickets for the
front seats from an extremely friendly and pock-marked
person, who wore a black patch over one eye. When we
got inside we found there were not many spectators in our
part of the house, but the pit, at the back, was already
crowded.</p>

<p>“That’s the thunder and lightning over there,” said
George, jocosely, “in other words, the nuts. How would
you like to be in among them?” But the stragglers who
kept dropping in and taking seats all round us did not
seem to me to be very different.</p>

<p>A branch of lights hung from the ceiling, and other lights
fell from the flies on to the curtainless stage. A kind of gray
mist, doubtless the accumulated smoke of many nights,
floated in the air, and a sickly-looking youth was hammering
out music-hall tunes on a worn-out, toneless piano. The
stage was quite bare, save for three double rows of yellow
wooden chairs, that composed three sides of a parallelogram,
and within which was a space marked off by a thick rope
stretched about four stout posts clamped to the floor. Over<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
this rope, at two diagonally opposite corners, hung towels,
and in each corner was a chair, a heap of sawdust, a basin,
a sponge, and a water-bottle. There was no person on
the stage, and these bare accessories, possibly because I
saw them now for the first time, had to my eyes a most
suggestive appearance. I began to feel excited: this
unadorned stage appeared to me to be distinctly thrilling.</p>

<p>By degrees the house filled up. The audience, though
mixed, was on the whole a very rough one, and there were
no women.</p>

<p>“Twig the peelers,” said George, and I noticed half a
dozen policemen lounge in and take up positions in different
parts of the auditorium.</p>

<p>At about five minutes to eight even the chairs on the
stage were filled, and, at eight sharp, an important person
with a cigar stepped into the ring, and made a short speech
introducing the first pair of boxers. He retired amid loud
applause, but the boxers, to my surprise, turned out to be
a couple of half-grown, ill-nourished, ill-washed lads, no
older than myself. They were naked except for short linen
drawers, and it seemed to me that it would have been no
harm had they been put into a bath prior to their appearance.
They grinned sheepishly at the audience, amongst
whom they evidently recognised “pals”; and these “pals,”
in turn, greeted them with cries of “Go it, Bob,” “Go on,
the wee lad,” “Go on, the stripes”—this last in allusion
to Bob’s unambitious costume, which had all the appearance
of being simply a pair of bathing-drawers. They shook
hands in a nerveless way, without looking at each other,
and began to spar feebly. Bob was so thin you could
count his ribs, and the big gloves at the ends of his long
skinny arms looked like gigantic puff-balls. The “wee
lad” was sturdier, but he seemed to me to be slightly
deformed. Even to my inexperienced eye it was perfectly
obvious that the main concern of both was not to get hurt,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
and they hadn’t finished the first round before the audience
was shouting, “Take them off them! Take them off them!”
This was in allusion to the gloves, but they also shouted
other things, most of which I daresay I had heard before,
though never so many at one time, and I reflected that
George had managed to steer fairly clear of the “Sankey
and Moody touch.”</p>

<p>The referee cautioned the unfortunate combatants, but
the second round was no better than the first, and in the
middle of the third round the fight was stopped. The
sleek, well-fed persons occupying the chairs, and the more
impatient persons occupying the auditorium, had not paid
their money for stuff of that sort. There followed a fresh
pair of boxers, older, more experienced, and this time
things were sufficiently brisk. The battle was a hard,
ding-dong struggle, and it was at least exciting. At the
sight of the first dark ugly streak of blood on one of those
white faces I felt a little queer, in fact my impulse was to
go away; but as round after round passed, and I watched
the blood from the same wound burst out afresh in each,
it began to quicken a sort of unsuspected lust of cruelty
in me, and I took pleasure in it, I wanted the fight to be
a real one, the thud of a blow that got home thrilled me.
It was as if I had undergone some transformation. The
dirty theatre, the low faces, the foul language, ceased to
matter. I was carried out of myself. I longed at the
same time for the fight to continue, and for its climax.
There would be only three more rounds, and I wanted,
before the last, to see somebody knocked out. The man
whose face was bleeding was the heavier of the two, but
I thought he had little chance. He was out-matched, he
must have known it himself, and yet he continued to come
up with a kind of dogged stupidity. His seconds spat
water into his face, sponged him, rubbed him and fanned
him, slapped him with towels and massaged his muscles;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
but the artificial invigoration this produced lasted only a
few moments after the beginning of each round, and, as I
watched him weakening, I could feel myself delivering the
blows that dazed him, my muscles tightened and slackened,
I could hardly sit in my seat. “Now he’s got him,” I
said aloud, as he staggered into the ring for the last time.
There was a blow and a crash on the boards. The referee
was counting over him, one—two—three—four—five—six—seven—eight;
and then this helpless creature, out of
whose swollen, hideous face all humanity had been battered,
staggered up almost blindly. He did not even lift his
hands to protect himself from the blow that smashed him
down again, and with that dull thud on the floor the fight
came to an end. He lay on after the counting had stopped,
and as I watched him being supported, almost carried, out
of the ring, while the victor received congratulations, a
pang of misgiving assailed me. There was no doubt the
whole thing was absolutely brutal, and there was equally
no doubt that when it had been most brutal I had been
most pleased.</p>

<p>I should like to be able to add that I got up and left the
theatre. I did not. I reflected that <em>the</em> fight was still to
come: I even waited for it eagerly, and when it took place,
I was disappointed because nobody bled, and because the
decision was given on points at the end of the twelfth round.</p>

<p>As we walked home I proved to George that boxing
matches were really all right; that they were infinitely
less dangerous than football matches. Every one of my
arguments convinced George, and after I had finished he
found some for himself, which I accepted as equally incontrovertible.
Considering that there was nobody to take
up an opposite point of view, our apologies might have
appeared hardly necessary, but George was able to give
me, in addition, a list of all the good qualities fighting
brought out, or even brought into existence. Most of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
these did not exactly fit in with my more superficial
impression of the audience, and there were others I could
not help feeling many of them would be better without—courage,
for instance. I had a dim idea that a little extra
courage might result in a majority of them figuring at the
next Assizes.</p>

<p>But when we were three-quarters way home I said to
George, “It was all pretty beastly, and that’s why we
liked it—eh?”</p>

<p>He got quite offended, telling me that if <em>he</em> had thought
it beastly he wouldn’t have waited on to the end, as
I did.</p>

<p>This was just possible, yet my opinion of George sank.
“If you admire it so much,” I said, “I’ll give you a turn
any time you like.”</p>

<p>George was silent, and flushed slightly.</p>

<p>“Well?” I kept on, pugnaciously.</p>

<p>George mumbled something, I don’t know what, and
I saw that I had actually frightened him. We walked
the rest of the way home in silence. George was angry
with me, but when we were in the house and had sat down
to supper he became friendly again. As I discovered later,
company was the one thing absolutely indispensable to
him; he could have kept on being angry with me, and,
indeed, would have enjoyed doing so, had he had anybody
else to talk to, but solitude he could not bear. And I, on
my side, forgot his having sulked on the way home, just
as, later on, I was to forget more than one unpleasant thing,
simply because he amused me, because he could always
make me laugh.</p>

<p>After supper I said good-night to the others, and George
and I went upstairs. George went in front of me and lit
the gas in the bedroom. “Is this my room?” I asked,
noticing that there were two beds in it.</p>

<p>“Yours an’ mine,” George answered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span></p>

<p>His reply was unexpected. I had never slept with anybody
in my life, and it had not occurred to me that I should
not have a room to myself. I said nothing, but George,
who was far from stupid, saw I did not like the arrangement.
“There is no other room,” he admitted frankly.
“I thought you knew. I thought ma put it in her letter.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t see her letter,” I murmured.</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ll be all right together, won’t we?” George
went on, pacifically. “You can have your bed moved
wherever you would like it best.” He had already begun
to undress, and, after hanging up his jacket, he took a photograph
from an inside pocket and handed it to me. It was
the photograph of a lady extremely lightly clad. “I’ve
better ones than that,” said George, with a peculiar smile.
He went to a corner near the window and raised a loose
board. From the hollow beneath he drew out a large fat
envelope, but, as he looked at me, he hesitated. “I’ll show
them to you some other time,” he suddenly said, and
returned the envelope to its hiding-place. He undressed
rapidly, and got into bed.</p>

<p>I took longer, and all the time I felt George’s eyes fixed
on me curiously. I hated this lack of privacy. It wasn’t
that I hadn’t undressed hundreds of times before other
boys, when we were going to bathe; but this was different.
I disliked the feeling of not being alone. I hated to have
somebody watch me all the time I was taking off my clothes,
or folding them. I determined to write to my father in
the morning.</p>

<p>When I was in bed and in the dark I wanted to think of
Katherine. I did this every night; I looked forward to it,
because it seemed to me that this was the hour when everything
became clearer; besides, there was always the chance
that if I thought of her I might dream of her. But now
George began to talk.</p>

<p>“Do you know any girls?” he asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span></p>

<p>“No,” I answered, shortly.</p>

<p>“Don’t you like them?” George persisted.</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“What do you think of Miss Izzy? Not bad—eh?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know anything about her.”</p>

<p>George was silent a few minutes. Then, just as I was
beginning to think my own thoughts, he began again.</p>

<p>“She’s nothin’ compared to Miss Johnson—the girl we
were talkin’ about to-day—who’s gettin’ married. Miss
Johnson was in the shop before Miss Izzy came. Ma sacked
her for givin’ lip. Ma sacks them all.”</p>

<p>George continued to talk until he grew sleepy, and I
had no choice but to listen.</p>

</div>


<p>Next morning I was awakened by somebody singing, and
opening my eyes I saw George, in his shirt and trousers,
strutting up and down the middle of the floor, a hair-brush
in his hand. It took me half a minute to realise where I
was, but George, when he saw I was awake, proceeded to
give me imitations of various music-hall artists, until there
was a sharp rap at our door, and Aunt Margaret’s voice
told him to remember what day it was. With that I remembered
myself, and simultaneously made up my mind
that I wasn’t going to church. I determined that now I
was away from home I would be my own master, and do
just what seemed good in my own eyes, and that I would
begin this policy at once.</p>

<p>Our room was at the back of the house, and from where
I lay I could see through the window a strip of gray, desolate
sky, broken here and there by a chimney, and across which
the dark branch of an unhealthy tree waved. As I watched
it, my mind strayed to a book of Japanese decorations, and
to the library at Derryaghy, and to other things I cared
for. I had already guessed from the little I had seen of
the McAllisters that their fortunes were drooping. It was
not so much that everything in the house was worn out
and patched and on its last legs, that the children were
ill-clad and looked ill-nourished, as that I seemed to scent
that mysterious atmosphere of anxiety, worry, and struggle,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
which invariably accompanies a decreasing ability to
pay one’s way. I hated it. I hated all that it implied—sordid
economies and cheap pleasures, a degrading and
enchaining struggle to keep things going. It did not
awaken pity in me, but only disgust. It was like a horrible
monster that clung and squeezed with a thousand slimy
tentacles, sapping your strength, and sucking out your
life-blood. I could even sympathise with those who had
freed themselves from it by some bold decisive action,
that might lie well outside the laws of morality and society.</p>

<p>In the midst of these reflections George informed me that I
had better get up. He was tying his tie. His red hair was
carefully plastered down with water, and he was examining
his small, freckled face in the looking-glass. George
had not yet begun to shave, but he had long, silly-looking
hairs growing out of his chin, and I thought he looked
extremely ugly and horribly common as he stood there.</p>

<p>When we went downstairs the others were just beginning
breakfast. The whole family was terribly <i lang="fr">endimanchée</i>.
Aunt Margaret was redolent of cheap scent. Gordon and
Thomas were dressed in green plush with white mother-of-pearl
buttons. Their little, damp, red, snub noses seemed to
have been set that very morning accidentally in the middle of
their round faces, which were of the complexion of fresh
putty, and their eyes were exactly like blue glass marbles.
Uncle George, who was breakfasting in his gray shirt sleeves,
suggested that I might like to go with George to the Bible-class,
but I refused. I added, to prevent all future trouble,
that I preferred to take a walk on Sunday morning.</p>

<p>“Do you go for walks when you are at home?” Aunt
Margaret asked me, with her strange smile.</p>

<p>“No,” I answered.</p>

<p>“Doesn’t your father expect you to go to church?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what he expects, I’m sure.”</p>

<p>“And don’t you think yourself you ought to go?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span></p>

<p>“No.” I was quite certain about this at all events, and
I added that, once you were familiar with any particular
ideas, no matter how valuable, I couldn’t see that you
gained very much by listening to them being repeated
ad infinitum.</p>

<p>This explanation, far from convincing, evidently annoyed,
Aunt Margaret, though she only said, “I would rather you
didn’t talk like that before the children. They have been
brought up to look upon religion with respect.”</p>

<p>I did not reply.</p>

<p>“I think I’ll go for a walk too,” George announced, with
a wink at me.</p>

<p>“You’ll do nothing of the sort,” cried Aunt Margaret,
flaring up into a shrill rage. “You see what comes of such
talk! I’ll have no Sabbath-breaking in this house.”</p>

<p>“Ssh—ssh,” Uncle George mildly intervened. “To
force people to do things against their will isn’t the proper
way to take.”</p>

<p>“You want your children to give up going to church,
then?”</p>

<p>“Nobody is giving up going to church. George is coming
of course. Young people very often say things without
meaning them. If Peter is for taking a walk this morning,
I expect he will come out with us this evening to hear Dr.
Russell, won’t you, Peter?”</p>

<p>But, altogether apart from Dr. Russell, that Sunday was
a dreary day. In the afternoon I accompanied George, and
we loafed about in the Ormeau Park, where he was evidently
accustomed to meet his friends. These friends of George’s
were all in business, and all looked upon themselves as young
men. They smoked cheap cigarettes, wore their handkerchiefs
in their sleeves, and were tremendously knowing and
rakish, while the larger part of their conversation appeared
to be concerned with the merits of professional football
players. I could get on all right with George when he was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
by himself, but his friends, among whom he was remarkably
popular, did not improve him. It took no great perspicacity
to discover that they on their side regarded my company as a
very questionable acquisition. This feeling, far from
diminishing, obviously increased as the afternoon advanced.
George described our adventure of the night before with
immense gusto, and gave a burlesque imitation of the knock-out.
To have an appreciative audience was his greatest
delight, and the others, for that matter, left him a fairly
free stage. Now that he had them he ignored me utterly,
so that, in the end, I was left practically alone. I fulfilled
a sort of highly disagreeable rôle of silent hanger-on. I did
it most reluctantly, yet I could not summon up sufficient
moral courage to go away.</p>

</div>


<p>On Monday morning I went to school. I arrived half an
hour before the proper time, and as my classes had already
been arranged, I had nothing to do but loiter about and take
stock of the place. It stood, a long, low, unlovely building
of soot-darkened brick, in its own grounds, not far from the
centre of the town. Just now, on this gray autumn morning,
it presented an appearance of singular, of almost jail-like
dullness, though in summer, as I was to learn, when the
grass was green, and the tall dusty elms waved against a
blue sky, and the sun shone through narrow, small-paned
windows, and splashed on wooden floors, on hacked wooden
desks and forms, on faded maps, and bare, discoloured
walls, it could be pleasant enough, in spite of the complete
absence of anything save the sunlight and the trees that
might appeal to a sense of beauty. Beside the main building
was a Preparatory School, and at the back, separated
from it by a yard, where a score or so of boys were at present
kicking about a football, were the Mathematical Schools,
and beyond these, the larger playing-field. It was really
a day-school, only two masters living on the premises, with
about a couple of dozen boarders: the rest of the scholars,
numbering between a hundred and fifty and two hundred,
were day-boys.</p>

<p>As I hung about uneasily, not venturing to join the others,
I was painfully conscious of my isolation. Not one of those<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
faces had I ever seen before, nor had I the slightest knowledge
of the school itself, for George, who had been at a
National School, could tell me nothing about it. Nobody
took any notice of me. Several masters passed, and disappeared
through mysterious doors, and when, at ten o’clock, a
white-haired, white-bearded patriarch rang a huge hand-bell
in the porch, and I watched the boys scattering with extraordinary
rapidity in various directions, it looked to me as if
I might very easily spend my whole day in the yard. I had
no idea which door to try, yet at the same time I was anxious
not to be late. I was still hovering uncertainly about the
porch, like a soul strayed into the wrong Paradise, when a
boy, running past, glanced at me, stopped, and asked me
where I wanted to go to.</p>

<p>I told him I wanted to go to Mr. Lowden’s class.</p>

<p>“It’s the end door on the left over there,” he said, good-humouredly,
and I thanked him and hurried off.</p>

<p>Coming in, I found the whole class already in their places,
but a boy at the end of the third form moved up to make
room for me, and I sat down. Mr. Lowden, who was standing,
with a piece of chalk in one hand and a duster in the
other, close by the black-board, asked me my name, and
then informed me I was late and that he objected to lateness.
I said nothing, but took down on the slate in front of me the
sum he had just written out.</p>

<p>I worked at it, and was struck by the animated conversations
that were going on all over the room, in spite of Mr.
Lowden’s efforts to check them.</p>

<p>“Has anybody finished yet?” Mr. Lowden asked, and
the boy who had moved up to make room for me held up his
hand, cracking his fingers. I glanced at him. He had a
round, merry face, rosy cheeks, bright eyes and dimples.</p>

<p>“How often have I told you not to crack your fingers,
Knox?” asked Mr. Lowden, discontentedly. “Well, what
answer do you get?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span></p>

<p>“Ten bob, a deuce an’ a make.”</p>

<p>“Come in to-day, Knox, at recess.”</p>

<p>He wrote down another sum, and I had begun to copy it,
when something went off with a sharp report under my feet.
Mr. Lowden was gazing straight at me, and he instantly told
me to stay in at recess.</p>

<p>I knew well enough what had happened, that I had trodden
on a wax match softened and rolled up with the head
inside. I told Mr. Lowden that I hadn’t done it on purpose.</p>

<p>“I can’t help that: you must stay in.”</p>

<p>“But it wasn’t my fault if I didn’t know it was there,”
I argued.</p>

<p>“You must stay in,” repeated Mr. Lowden, in a silly,
obstinate kind of voice, horribly irritating, “and, Knox, you
stay in after school as well as at recess.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see what <em>he</em> has to do with it, any way,” I
muttered.</p>

<p>The boy beside me laughed.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes: Knox put it there,” Mr. Lowden said monotonously.</p>

<p>I had taken a dislike to Mr. Lowden, and at the same time
I thought him a fool. A few days later something happened
to make me dislike him even more. He had read aloud a
problem which we were to work out mentally, putting down
our answers when he gave us the word. My answer was
right, but, unfortunately, when he asked me how I got it, the
problem itself had gone out of my head. For the life of me
I couldn’t remember it; yet I was ashamed to say so, and
simply sat silent while he repeated two or three times, as if
it were some kind of refrain, “Well, now, how did you
work the sum, Waring?”</p>

<p>As I was unable to tell him, he said, “You must have
copied the answer from Knox.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t,” I protested, angrily.</p>

<p>“Then why can’t you tell me how you got it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span></p>

<p>Again silence.</p>

<p>“You must be telling a lie, I’m afraid,” said Mr. Lowden,
in his apathetic voice, “and the silliest kind of lie, because
it’s obvious to everybody.”</p>

<p>“I’m not telling a lie.”</p>

<p>Mr. Lowden shrugged his shoulders; he never seemed to
get angry, or even moderately interested, no matter what
the circumstances. “If you’re not, then why can’t you tell
me how you worked the sum? If you had done it once,
you could do it again.”</p>

<p>“I did do it.”</p>

<p>“Well, how?”</p>

<p>Renewed silence.</p>

<p>“You’d better stay in at recess.”</p>

<p>And I stayed in.</p>

<p>Yet Mr. Lowden was really only a mild and inoffensive
young man, who had been inspired with the unlucky idea
that he could earn his living by teaching boys, when he had
neither the desire nor the capacity to understand them. The
aversion I felt for him was really founded primarily upon
grounds less rational than those I have mentioned. The
secret of the matter was that physically he was repulsive to
me. He suffered, I imagine, from some affection of the
lungs or throat, for he wore, winter and summer, a thick
white muffler, fastened by an opal pin. His face was pale,
cadaverous, and hollow-cheeked; his moustache scanty;
his hair lank and damp; but what I disliked most was his
peculiar odour. Whether this emanated from his person,
or from the pastilles he was perpetually sucking, I don’t
know. It was something sickly and persistent, and for no
reason that I know of I associated it with death. When he
sat down on the form beside me to work out a sum, I used
to edge gradually away from him, until he would notice it,
and ask me in a querulous voice what I was doing, and
perhaps keep me in. This physical repulsion I could never<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
have conquered, even had it not been backed up by that kind
of mental sickliness which characterized him, and which
had made him punish me once at least unjustly. He left
six months later, and nobody among the boys ever knew
or cared what became of him. Perhaps he went to another
school, perhaps the mysterious odour which had sickened
me had been really the odour of death....</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>When I think now of those who were in charge of my
education, upon my word I cannot help but be filled with
wonder. What did they teach me? What did I ever get
from them that I could not have got, with less trouble, for
myself? Never once did any of my masters show the
faintest interest in me, or make even the most perfunctory
attempt to get to know me, to get to know what I was
capable of, if I had any definite tastes, if I were good or bad,
moral or immoral, intelligent or a fool. What they did instead
was to ask me a couple of questions from a book, and, if
I failed to answer either of these satisfactorily, keep me in to
sit for twenty minutes with my lesson-book open on the desk
before me and my thoughts miles away. Of my masters
only one, Mr. Johnson, had any distinction, and he, unfortunately,
was a mathematician. He had written a “Euclid”
so perfect in its expression that he had managed to get a
kind of æsthetic charm into the dry bones of geometry. He
was an Englishman, but was slightly Jewish in type. He
wore a long, flowing beard and moustache, like an early
northern chief, and he had small, sleepy, gray eyes, which
during school hours were usually closed. Most of his time
he passed, either in reverie or slumber, in his chair on a daïs
at the end of the room; but when aroused he had, for the
unmathematical, a richly terrifying voice, and a disheartening
manner of slashing down a long black cane on the desk,
within a few inches of your nose. His classes were models
of order. Never a faintest sound. In dead silence you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
played your game of noughts and crosses, or did your Latin
composition, or wrote out cricket teams—but you never
spoke, and rarely moved. Of all those whose business it
was to mould my mind his figure remains the least spoiled
by time. I remember the shock I received when, some years
after I left school, I came upon Dr. Melling, the head English
master, in the Campo Santo at Pisa, sucking an orange, and
dressed in garments that Moses or Ikey would have bid for
but languidly. When I spoke to him he seemed so narrow,
so unimaginative, so unintelligent, that I felt half-ashamed,
as one might who has learned by accident a secret he ought
never to have known. Even in stature he was curiously
shrunken, though he neither stooped nor showed signs of
decrepitude or age. But Johnson I can see now, as I saw
him so often then, coming up the path between the two
front cricket-fields, a large black bag in his hand, which one
had been told contained his lunch. I can see him leaning
back in his chair, his eyes closed, like one of those beautiful
owls that ignore from their cage in the Zoo the staring
stranger, his beard spread out over his waistcoat, his hands
folded on his stomach. Johnson was a gentleman, and,
though he knew nothing of, and cared little for, boys, if
chance brought him into temporary relation with one, even
a very small and idle one, he took it for granted that he was
a gentleman too, and in his deep, slow, musical voice, and in
his sleepy eyes, there would come a curious charm.</p>

<p>I had formed no definite conception of what my new school
would be like, but there was a flatness about the reality
for which I was unprepared. I seemed to slip into my place
at once, without attracting the slightest attention either of
boys or masters, and at a week’s end any strangeness there
might have been had completely worn off. I did not play
football, which was the only game played this term. I got
to know a good many boys, but I formed no friendships.
I found my new companions to be, on the whole, little, if at
all, more congenial than the boys at Newcastle, in spite of
there being so many more to choose from. I liked them
well enough, and they were, with one exception, perfectly
decent to me, but it all ended there: that is to say, in my
relation with them I had invariably to approach them on
their own ground, I had to enter into <em>their</em> world, they were
incapable of entering into mine, or even of meeting me halfway.
There was a boy I had felt attracted to, purely on
account of his good-looks, and as our ways home lay in the
same direction I joined him one afternoon just as he was
going out at the gate. But the first words he uttered
shattered my illusions. He had a harsh, loud voice and
spoke through his nose. Almost at once he began to tell me
what he imagined to be a funny story, and before I had been
with him five minutes I said good-bye abruptly, and left
him standing on the pavement, staring after me, nor did I
ever speak to him again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span></p>

<p>Day by day I went to school, neither liking it nor disliking
it. Yet it was all rather dismal, for life without any kind
of human sympathy, either given or received, is a dreadful,
almost an impossible, thing. I thought a good deal of
Katherine, and wrote to her, but got only an occasional
scrappy note in reply. I did not see much of George, for he
was kept in his business till nearly seven o’clock, and in the
evenings I had to prepare my work for the next day. George,
moreover, had his own circle of friends, none of whom, as I
have said, were particularly eager for my company, while
George himself, when he was among them, was the least
eager of all. Sometimes when I was with him alone I would
remember this and resent it, but he could always make me
forgive him when he wanted to: he could be extraordinarily
pleasant when he wanted to, and it was impossible to be
bored in his company.</p>

<p>We still shared the same bedroom, and at night he
liked to talk before going to sleep. He had obtained a
considerable influence over me, more than anybody else
ever did or was to do, yet it is difficult to describe what it
consisted in, or why it should have come about. I had an
extremely poor opinion of him: I knew he had not even a
rudimentary conscience: frequently he repelled, and even
disgusted, me: but always, by some instinct, he seemed
to know when he had done so, and he had a special gift for
recovering lost ground. His influence was bad—absolutely—and
yet what was so harmful to me did not, so far as I
know, have any particularly disastrous effect upon George
himself. He had an amazingly licentious imagination, and,
in this direction, a power of vivid suggestion. As I became
more accustomed to him, things that had at first jarred
upon me ceased to do so; but it was doubly unfortunate
that I should have been thrown so intimately into his
society just at this particular time. Had I been either
older or younger, or had I had any other friends, the effect<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
would not have been so injurious. It was not that I had
not heard my share of Rabelaisian talk before. This was,
somehow, different. At all events, the other had passed
off me easily, awakening no after-thoughts, leaving my
senses untroubled. It was not so now. My mind became
disturbed, and, above all, my dreams were coloured by
certain obsessions which George took a delight in evoking.
In my dreams his suggestions became realities, and his
imagination seemed to brood over them like an evil angel.
I do not think he was himself conscious of it, conscious, that
is, that what for him appeared to be no more than a sort
of intellectual pastime, which he could shake from him as
easily as one might turn off a tap, assumed with me a darker
form. His words appeared to touch me physically, and
with an appalling directness and persistency. He had a
trick of re-telling stories he had read, twisting them and
altering them with an astonishing ingenuity, so as to introduce
the element he revelled in, and he never became crude
or brutal till he had carefully prepared his ground. And
it was all transformed by a curious gift of humour, which
was in itself something quite inimitable, consisting, as it
did, largely in his personality and manner, in an unquenchable
liveliness, and a faculty of mimicry.</p>

<p>Two months went by in this fashion, and I had begun to
look forward to Christmas and to count the weeks that
separated me from the holidays, when an incident occurred
which was the means of my forming an acquaintance that
was to develop into the most intimate friendship of my life.
It befell in this way.</p>

<p>A series of thefts had been committed, thefts of school-books.
A boy would leave his books down on a window-sill,
or even in a class-room, and when he came to get them
again, one would perhaps be missing. I had never lost
anything myself, and knew nothing of what was going on
till the afternoon when the matter was divulged to the
entire school.</p>

<p>It was not far from three o’clock, I remember, the hour
when we broke up for the day, and I was in one of the
English class-rooms, where, every Monday, if you liked
to pay half-a-crown a term extra, you had the advantage
of a lesson in elocution from Mr. (or was it Professor?)
Lennox. Professor Lennox was a fat, pale, absurd little
man, with a high-pitched tenor voice that struck against
the drum of your ear like the blow of a stick. He waxed
his moustache, and greased his hair into carefully arranged,
solid-looking locks, while his skin, by some natural process,
greased itself. Professor Lennox was an amateur of fancy
trousers, of coloured waistcoats, of large breast-pins, of spats<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
with pearl buttons, and of rings more striking than precious.
To-day the whole class—some fifty or sixty boys—was reading
after him, line by line, a poem from Bell’s “Elocution.”</p>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“In arms, / the Aust / rian phal / anx stood,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">A liv / ing wall, / a hum / an wood.</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Impreg / nable / their front / appears,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">All hor / rent with / project / ing spears.”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="noi">Or, as it sounded according to local pronunciation, shared
impartially by the professor and the majority of his pupils:</p>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“In arms, / the Orst / rian phah / lanx stude,</div>

  </div>
</div>

<p>We had just reached “projacting spears,” when Dr.
Melling, better known by the name of Limpet, came in,
followed by an old woman, who paused on the threshold.
Limpet turned round and waved her forward impatiently,
but a couple of yards from the door she stopped again, and
all the time she stared hard at us with small, sharp, gray
eyes. Her bright little eyes and hooked nose, taken with her
air of timidity, gave her the appearance of an innocent and
frightened witch who has been dragged out of her lair
very much against her will. I wondered who she was,
but Limpet did not leave us long in doubt. It appeared
that some boy had stolen a number of school-books, the
property of various other boys, and had sold them to this
woman, who was now here to identify him. Limpet
explained the situation with an air of wishing to get a
disagreeable duty over as quickly as possible, but to us
it was quite exciting. Each of us in turn stood up to undergo
the witch’s scrutiny. She had already, as I afterwards
learned, been round the other classes, and Limpet, who
had accompanied her on this voyage of discovery, was by
now in rather a bad temper. Evidently he found the whole<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
business singularly distasteful, and as one boy after another
received her head-shake, he fidgeted and frowned nervously.
She herself looked frightened and bewildered; I expect
she was secretly worried about her own share in the matter,
and considering how she could make the best of it. As for
me, I felt for the first time as if school-life really bore some
faint resemblance to the tales of the <cite>Boy’s Own Paper</cite>.
Here was one of the pet adventures actually taking place,
except that the old woman should have been a man with
a small fur cap. When it came to my turn to stand up, I
had an extraordinary wish that she would pick me out as
the culprit. Sure of my innocence, I had a mind to be the
hero of this adventure, and I stood so long, waiting to be
identified, that Limpet told me sharply to sit down, and I
could see had it on the tip of his tongue to give me an
imposition. My neighbour tugged me by the jacket, and
I resumed my seat abruptly amid suppressed laughter.
One by one each boy rose in his place and sat down again,
and then, in the back row of all, a boy stood up who <em>was</em>
identified. This boy I did not know except by name, though
he was in all my classes. He was called Gill, and I had
always looked upon him as rather odd and unapproachable.
When his turn came, he stood up indifferently, glancing
out through the window at the clock, which could only be
seen when you were on your feet. But next moment I
saw the old woman say something to Limpet, and the latter
instantly told Gill to stand out.</p>

<p>Gill stood out, his indifference gone, his face flushed and
angry.</p>

<p>“Is that the boy?” Limpet asked, as if daring her to
say “Yes,” but the old woman mumbled out an affirmative.</p>

<p>“Do you know anything of this, Gill?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>I was somehow pleased that he had not added the customary
“Sir.” He stood with his head up and gazed straight<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
at Limpet and the old woman, with a kind of contemptuous
wrath, his gray eyes dark and very bright, a frown on his
face.</p>

<p>The old woman was so obviously uncertain and uncomfortable
that the whole thing appeared to me ridiculous,
and I impulsively gave voice to this impression. “She
doesn’t know anything about it,” I called out. “Anybody
could see she’s only trying it on.”</p>

<p>Limpet on the spot gave me two hundred of Sir Walter
Scott’s bad verses to write out. My remark had the effect,
nevertheless, of drawing a wavering expression of uncertainty
from the old woman herself, which, in his now undisguised
irritability, Limpet pounced on, as a cat pounces
on a mouse. “Why did you point to him, if you don’t
know?” he whipped out, frightening her nearly out of
her wits. “Don’t you understand that it’s a serious thing
to bring an accusation of theft against a boy? Sit down,
Gill. I want to see you after school.”</p>

<p>He was so angry that he forgot all about the half-dozen
remaining boys, and conducted his companion unceremoniously
from the room.</p>

<p>Gill sat staring straight in front of him. Certainly he
did not look guilty. He had a dark, narrow face, with a
bright complexion. His thick, rough, black hair grew low
on an oval, narrow forehead, and between his clear gray
eyes there started a high-bridged, somewhat aggressive-looking
nose, the most striking feature of his rather striking
face. He had the reputation of being a peculiar kind of
chap, and he was sometimes made fun of—mildly, for he was
extremely quick-tempered and very strong—but anybody
could see that he was a fine fellow, and that an accusation
such as had just been brought against him would require
a great deal of proof.</p>

<p>When the bell rang he remained on in his seat while the
rest of us went out, I hung about the porch watching two<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
little fellows playing chestnuts, and when they stopped
playing I still hung about with nothing to watch, and with,
indeed, no very definite purpose in view. Presently Gill
emerged, but whether he saw me or not, he took no notice,
as he walked on swiftly down toward the gate.</p>

<p>Since I had flung about him the mantle of my protection,
however, I had begun to take a lively interest in him, and
before he had gone fifty yards I made up my mind and
hurried in pursuit. He looked round at the sound of my
footsteps and waited, but without smiling. I had an idea
he had passed me deliberately in the porch, and now he
received me coldly enough. As we walked along together
he made no attempt to defend himself against the charge
that had been brought against him; he did not even refer
to it, nor to what had taken place during his subsequent
interview with Limpet, from whom, nevertheless, he received
next morning a public apology. Though I was
simply dying to hear what had happened I couldn’t very
well ask, and as we proceeded I had to talk about other
things. Then, quite suddenly, some change seemed to take
place within him, and he inquired abruptly if I had read
any of the writings of Count Tolstoy. I had never even
heard of Count Tolstoy, but I was not to remain much
longer in ignorance. I like enthusiasm, and I got it now.
Gill had just finished “Anna Karénine,” and offered to
lend it to me, adding that it was in French. I had been
learning French in the way one did in those days, and
perhaps does still; that is to say, I had been learning it
for six or seven years, and was now obliged to confess I
couldn’t read it.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you coming out of your way?” he demanded
with the queer abruptness that characterized him.</p>

<p>“Oh, no.”</p>

<p>“Do you live up the Malone way?”</p>

<p>“No; I live in the town.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span></p>

<p>“Then why isn’t it out of your way?”</p>

<p>“That is only my fashion of telling you I want to come
with you,” I answered meekly. “Pure politeness.”</p>

<p>He did not smile. “You haven’t been at school long?”
he asked. His manner was the oddest mixture of stiffness
and shyness, and sometimes he frowned portentously, while
at the slightest thing he blushed.</p>

<p>“No,” I answered. “Have you?”</p>

<p>“Yes—all my life—ever since I was a kid.” He spoke
quickly, one would have imagined impatiently.</p>

<p>“Have you? I thought, somehow, you hadn’t.”</p>

<p>I don’t know why I should have made this wise remark,
nor, apparently, did Gill.</p>

<p>“Why?” he asked me at once.</p>

<p>I laughed. “You don’t seem to have very many friends.”</p>

<p>He coloured, and I realized that my remark had been
lacking in tact.</p>

<p>“I have as many friends as I want,” he answered shortly.</p>

<p>I saw I had touched him on a tender spot. “Does that
mean you don’t want any new ones?” I ventured, half-laughing,
though I was serious enough.</p>

<p>His answer was startling. “Perhaps you think you are
doing me a favour by walking home with me?”</p>

<p>I did not say anything, but I looked at him with some
astonishment. He was so odd that his manner had the
effect of divesting me of all the shyness I usually suffered
from myself on making a new acquaintance, nor did I even
feel angry at his rebuff.</p>

<p>“I came with you,” I said at length, “to please myself.”</p>

<p>He turned crimson, began to speak, was silent, and then
apologized.</p>

<p>At the garden gate I would have left him, but he insisted
on my coming up to the door. “I will get you ‘Anna
Karénine’; then we can talk about it together—if we’re
going to be friends.” He spoke the last words shyly, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
I knew that he had found a difficulty in saying them
at all.</p>

<p>“But I told you I couldn’t read French.”</p>

<p>“You can if you like. Don’t try to translate it; read
straight ahead.”</p>

<p>He came back with two books bound in gray-blue paper,
which he handed to me. “It doesn’t matter if the covers
get torn or the books come to pieces. My father gets them
all rebound in any case. By the way,” once more he
blushed, “you needn’t bother about those lines Limpet
gave you.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Because I’ll be doing them.”</p>

<p>“Oh, rot.”</p>

<p>He frowned. “You can do them if you like, but it will
be a waste of time.”</p>

<p>“I know that.”</p>

<p>“I mean, I’m going to do them in any case, whether you
do or not.”</p>

<p>I laughed. “Couldn’t we each do half?”</p>

<p>“I’m going to do them all.”</p>

<p>“All right.”</p>

<p>He strolled back down the garden path with me. “What’s
your name?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Waring.”</p>

<p>“I know that. I mean your first name.”</p>

<p>“Peter.”</p>

<p>“Mine is Owen. I’ll come part of the way back with
you: I told them inside.”</p>

<p>“Shall I call you Owen?”</p>

<p>“I don’t care,” he answered quickly, without looking
at me. But before we had gone another hundred yards
he said: “That isn’t the truth. I told you my name
because I wanted you to call me by it.”</p>

<p>“All right,” I said, smiling.</p>

<p>That night, for the first time, I felt George’s fascination
falter, and it is a fact rather melancholy in its significance
that this consciousness came to me in the form of a sense of
freedom, of relief. He began to talk to me, just as usual,
as soon as he had turned out the light, but I told him
brusquely to shut up, that I wanted to go to sleep, and
when he tried to begin again I let him see I was in earnest.</p>

<p>As I lay there I determined that at Christmas I would
make another effort to get into rooms of my own choosing.
If I wanted to ask Owen Gill, for instance, to come to see
me, how could I do so? For one thing, his people would
not like him to come here; for another, I should not myself
care to ask him. I was by this time firmly convinced
that my aunt was frequently more or less under the influence
of drugs. It may have been on account of her illness;
I could not say; but there were times when she seemed
hardly to know what she was doing, and at such moments
her dislike for me, which she usually more or less successfully
concealed, jumped to the surface. I had no idea how
long she had been in this condition; I was quite sure my
father knew nothing about it; yet she appeared to me to
have already lost something of her hold upon reality. I
had heard her make statements so obviously untrue that
they could have deceived nobody but Uncle George. I
had heard her repeat a harmless remark made by Miss Izzy,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
and, by altering it ever so slightly, give it a quite new and
highly disagreeable meaning. But Uncle George never
dreamed of contradicting her, whether it was that he was
afraid of her, or whether he was simply blind, I could not tell.</p>

<p>On the Sunday after my becoming acquainted with
Owen I was alone in the house with little Alice, who had
been unwell and had not gone out with the others to morning
church. As usual, she had climbed up on my knee, and
was sitting with her thin brown arms round my neck, and
her queer little face close to mine.</p>

<p>“Ma looked through all your pockets yesterday morning,
when you were at school,” she said.</p>

<p>“What pockets?” I asked quietly.</p>

<p>“The pockets of your clothes—every one.”</p>

<p>“Well, did she find anything?” I murmured, in as
indifferent a tone as I could manage.</p>

<p>“She found a letter—and some other things.”</p>

<p>“And did she read the letter?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“How do you know? Where were you?”</p>

<p>“I saw her.”</p>

<p>“How did you see her?”</p>

<p>“I saw her through the key-hole.”</p>

<p>“Oh; I didn’t think you would look through key-holes.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t you? I do—often.”</p>

<p>“You shouldn’t. It isn’t nice, you know. You must
never do it again.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Because it’s not a nice thing to do. It’s spying.”</p>

<p>“I’ve often done it,” said Alice, with perfect detachment.
“I’ve looked at you through the key-hole.”</p>

<p>“You must never do it again. Promise, or I won’t
be friends with you any more.”</p>

<p>“If I promise, will you be friends?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span></p>

<p>“Yes. But you must keep your promise, remember.”</p>

<p>I returned to “Anna Karénine.” “I must buy a desk,”
I thought, “or some kind of box I can lock up.” Presently
little Alice began again. “I’ve got a secret.”</p>

<p>I had lugubrious forebodings in regard to this secret.
“Have you?” I answered dismally.</p>

<p>“Don’t take any soup to-day,” the child said, softly.</p>

<p>I laid down my book. There was something arresting
about this injunction, something even startling. I looked
into the strange dark eyes that seemed almost to fill the
small elf-like face, and I knew that a confidence of a highly
unpleasant character was imminent.</p>

<p>“I put a dead mouse into the soup,” little Alice whispered.</p>

<p>“Oh;” I exclaimed feebly. I felt inclined to put her
down very abruptly from my knee, and it was with difficulty
that I controlled this impulse. “What made you
do such a thing? Now it will all be wasted.”</p>

<p>“Nobody knows about it,” the child continued artlessly,
rubbing her cheek against mine. “Once I put something
in before, when people were coming for dinner. It was
fun to watch them all looking so stiff and solemn, and eating
away, and not knowing what was there all the time. I
laughed so much that ma sent me out of the room. But
I wouldn’t do that with you, because I love you.”</p>

<p>Her strange little face turned to mine, and her eyes were
fixed on me. She must have seen the disgust I felt, for she
began to tremble and her eyes filled with tears. Then she
hid her face against my shoulder and clung to me. I was
frightened to scold her. Even without my having said
anything she seemed to shrivel up like some bruised and
broken plant. I patted her head gently, and at once she
brightened. She got down from my knee and began to
dance about the floor.</p>

<p>Meanwhile I was left with the problem of the soup. If<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
the soup were strained the mouse, I supposed, would be
discovered; but if it were, as it was practically certain to be,
simply turned out into a tureen, the revelation might come
too late. On the other hand, were I to turn informer, little
Alice would most surely be whipped, and, whether she deserved
it or not, the idea of that was as revolting to me as
would be the ill-treatment of a sick monkey. There was a
young girl in the kitchen who looked after the rougher
work, and I thought of explaining the matter to her, after
swearing her to secrecy, but before I had made up my
mind I heard the others downstairs.</p>

<p>They had evidently got back from church, and now I
didn’t know what to do. Uncle George, preceded by
Gordon and Thomas in their green plush suits, came into
the parlour. Uncle George began to warm himself before
the gas-stove. “You should have come out this morning,
Peter,” he said, in his gentle voice. “You missed a treat.”</p>

<p>I listened to his comments on the sermon, feeling all the
time most uncomfortable. Gordon and Thomas tried to
climb about my chair, but I kept them off with a firm hand.
The parlour door was open, probably the kitchen door too,
for all at once there came a scream from that department,
not very loud, yet distinctly audible. I glanced at Alice.
The others hadn’t heard it. Uncle George was still in the
midst of his mild enthusiasm, and Gordon and Thomas,
flattening their little round red noses with a finger, were
practising squinting with remarkable success. Alice had
become perfectly still, her big black eyes fixed on mine:
and, as for me, I knew the mouse had been discovered and
felt vastly relieved. Conceive of my amazement, therefore,
when the soup after all appeared at table. Alice and I did
not take any, and Aunt Margaret did not either, so that
there was enough left to do Monday’s dinner; but of the
mouse I never heard again.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV</h2>
</div>


<p>My friendship with Owen was at present the one quite
satisfactory thing in my life. Neither at school nor at home
was I particularly successful. I worked very little, merely
sufficiently to prevent myself from getting into trouble; I
did not play games. I had gone to the School of Art for a
few weeks, but as I was never put to draw anything except
curves and squares and geometrical flowers, I got sick of
this and gave it up.</p>

<p>I saw a good deal of Owen, though not so much as I
should have liked. Of course I saw him every day at
school, but I had never been inside his house, and I could
not ask him to mine. I did not want to let him see the kind
of people I had sprung from. I was ashamed of them. On
Saturdays and Sundays we usually went for long walks
together, during which we threshed out the affairs of the
universe, and built it over again. It was all quite new to
me, just as was the peculiar type of Owen’s mind, its extraordinary
eagerness in the pursuit of ideas. My head
already swarmed with an amazing mass of unsettled
notions which buzzed in it like bees in a shaken hive. It
seemed to me we never discussed anything less serious than
the immortality of the soul. Owen was not sure of the
existence of God, and I, so far as Christianity was concerned,
was an Agnostic also. But to Owen it appeared to make an
enormous difference, he was positively unhappy about it;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
while to me, though I did not let him suspect this, it was a
matter of supreme indifference. Levine’s acceptance of
Christianity, at the end of “Anna Karénine,” was for Owen
an endless source of dissatisfaction and query. We discussed
it by the hour. Yet, when actually reading the book,
I had been far more struck by the appearance in Wronsky’s
and Anna’s dreams of the strange little man, who seems to
pass out of vision into reality just before the suicide. What
did <em>that</em> mean? Why was he there? Had he, like some
added flick of colour in the work of a master, been put in,
not because he was there in Nature, but because he was
needed for the picture? For me, at any rate, he had the
effect of making all the rest more convincing, and, while he
appeared to be purely fantastic, of corresponding to some
esoteric reality. Or was the apparition at the railway
station also only a vision, in that case the vision of a vision?
To Owen such a question was of no interest whatever, and it
was Owen’s questions that we principally discussed.</p>

<p>Very often I walked home with him and hung swinging
on the iron gate while we finished an argument. At such
moments he exhibited an exhilarating eagerness, and he
was never anxious to get the better of me in merely verbal
dispute, as I frequently was of him. It was the thing in
itself he saw, and he went at it like a terrier at a rabbit-hole,
sending up showers of sand into the air, but never
getting to the bottom. Sometimes, when we were talking,
he would catch me by my arms and swing me slowly back
and forward. Sometimes he would draw me close up to
him till my face almost touched his, and his eyes seemed to
look straight into my spirit, and then he would suddenly
release me. He had a very quick and passionate temper,
and was ridiculously sensitive, so that, though I employed
infinitely more tact with him than I had ever done with
anybody else, I occasionally offended him. Then he would
leave me, his face as red as a turkey-cock, and his grey eyes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
dark and bright. Possibly for the rest of that day he
would ignore me utterly; indeed, the first time it
happened, I was sure we had quarrelled for ever. But the
next morning he came up to me with a shy and shamefaced
smile, saying he was sorry. At such times there
would come into his voice so charming a gentleness that
it was impossible to remain angry with him.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“Will you come to the opera to-night?” he asked me
one morning, looking up from an old, ink-stained Virgil.
We were sitting in the window-seat, where we always sat
together, and which just held two. As Dr. Gwynn, the head
Classical-master, was very old, very blind, and rather deaf,
it was possible to pass the time quite pleasantly in this
retreat.</p>

<p>I had not yet been inside a theatre, and Owen had been
but seldom. “What is on?” I asked.</p>

<p>“‘Faust.’”</p>

<p>“‘Faust’? All right.”</p>

<p>“I’ll meet you outside the theatre at a quarter to
seven.”</p>

<p>“Very well; I’ll be there.”</p>

<p>I went home straight from school, in order to get my work
done for the next day, but when I pushed open the door I
became conscious that an altercation between Aunt Margaret
and Miss Izzy was in progress in the other shop.
They were so busy that they did not even hear me enter,
though the shop-bell had rung, and, as I lingered on the
threshold, I gathered that the dispute was about a young
man, and I guessed who he was. I had seen him; his name
was Moore; he travelled in the stationery line, and he
admired Miss Izzy.</p>

<p>I heard Aunt Margaret’s familiar “<em>some</em> people,” with an
accent on the “some.” It was in this indirect manner that
she invariably produced her most disagreeable remarks,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
and it was very much in the air just now. Miss Izzy displayed
an icy dignity by stiff elbows, an erect head, and an
elaborate preoccupation with the business of the shop. She
seemed all collar and cuffs and freezing silence, which she
could not quite keep up, for every now and again she threw
out a retort. Aunt Margaret’s ponderous black form filled
up the inner doorway. Her large face, her drawn-in mouth,
her black, shining eyes, her wig, gave her an alarming and
bizarre appearance, but Miss Izzy was not in the least
alarmed.</p>

<p>I came in, not wishing to be caught listening. Miss Izzy
just cast a glance at me, and tossed her head.</p>

<p>I brushed past Aunt Margaret and went upstairs to my
dinner, leaving the parlour door open, however, so that I
might still hear the conflict going on below. When the
shop-bell rang Aunt Margaret’s voice would cease; then,
when the customer had departed, it would begin again.
Presently I heard Uncle George shuffling downstairs, and
his entrance on the scene was followed by an outburst of
both feminine voices together. The noise was becoming
exciting, but I could no longer make out the words, though
I hung over the balusters to listen. Then I heard Aunt
Margaret coming upstairs, and Uncle George following her.
She was in a violent passion. “Fool—fool—fool,” she
screamed at him all along the passage. Then came confused
remonstrances in Uncle George’s quiet voice, but they
were interrupted by the banging of a door that shook the
whole house. I came out into the lobby once more. I heard
Uncle George trying to get into the room, but the door
must have been locked from the inside, and through it came
a shrill torrent of abuse. Uncle George’s face was white
and strange as he turned round and caught me staring at
him. He told me to go away, but almost immediately he
came after me into the parlour, where I had sat down again
to my dinner. He told me Aunt Margaret was not well,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
that she had had a very bad attack last night, and been
kept awake and in pain all night long. I could see that he
would have liked to know if I had grasped the nature of
several of those words that had come out to him through
the closed door, but I continued stolidly to eat my dinner,
without giving any sign. When I had finished, I got out
my books, but as soon as the coast was clear I slipped
downstairs to the shop. Miss Izzy was there alone, and
affected not to see me.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with Aunt Margaret?” I asked; at
which ingenuous question Miss Izzy gave a short contemptuous
laugh.</p>

<p>A blowzy girl, sucking a sweet, came in to buy a novelette,
and when she had gone I informed Miss Izzy that I was
going that night to hear “Faust.” Miss Izzy expressed
not the faintest interest in this project.</p>

<p>I turned over a book of views in melancholy silence—views
of the Linen Hall Library, and of Donegall Place; of
the Cave Hill, and the Albert Memorial; and I wondered if
it would please Katherine were I to send her a complete set.
I looked at the price, written in Miss Izzy’s secret code, on
the back, and could not make up my mind.</p>

<p>“When people can’t control themselves there are places
where they can have people to look after them,” Miss Izzy
announced to a bundle of “Horner’s Penny Stories,” which
she next moment swept viciously into a corner.</p>

<p>This cryptic remark I took as referring to Aunt Margaret,
but, seeing my expectant face, Miss Izzy unkindly refused to
follow it up.</p>

<p>I was disheartened, and began to read aloud advertisements
of art books from the back of a magazine I had
bought on my way home. The third of these bore the
simple title “Michael Angelo,” and Miss Izzy astonished me
by saying, “That’s one of Marie Corelli’s.”</p>

<p>I ventured to tell her that Michael Angelo was a great<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
painter and sculptor, but the information was lost on Miss
Izzy, who in the midst of it said sharply, “Oh, don’t bother.”</p>

<p>I waited for a while, digesting this snub. Then, “Was
she talking about Mr. Moore?” I asked, indiscreetly.</p>

<p>Miss Izzy regarded me at first mildly and absently, but as
the sense of my question slowly forced its way through the
meshes of her cogitations, suddenly in extreme wrath: “If
you’d mind your own business,” she snapped, “you’d hear
fewer lies. I don’t know what you’re doing down here at
all!”</p>

<p>“I’m doing nothing,” I answered, crestfallen.</p>

<p>“People talk about girls being curious and gossiping,”
Miss Izzy went on, scornfully, “but if other boys are like
you——”</p>

<p>I retired upstairs without waiting for the conclusion of
the parallel. I worked for an hour and a half, and by then
it was tea-time. Aunt Margaret did not appear, and we
were told she was lying down. George, who had come
home earlier than usual, inquired where I was going to, and
when I informed him, asked if he might come too. I did
not like to refuse, though I did not want him, and knew he
and Owen would not get on together. I told him I was
going with Owen.</p>

<p>“Is that the chap you’re so thick with? I don’t suppose
he’ll mind me, will he?”</p>

<p>I introduced them to each other at the theatre door.
We were early, and had nearly three-quarters of an hour to
wait. Owen and I began to talk, but our conversation
evidently bored George, who, in the midst of it, introduced
a characteristic remark of his own, at which I laughed,
though I did not want to. Owen, who did not always see a
joke, and who would have detested the best joke in the
world of the particular kind George most affected, instantly
relapsed into silence. He looked at George for a moment;
then he took a copy of the “Golden Treasury” translation of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
Plato’s “Republic” from his pocket and began to read. I
had known well enough something of this sort was bound to
happen, and I made no attempt to bridge it over. George
nudged me with his elbow and closed his left eye. Owen’s
disapproval did not put him about in the least, and he
continued to chatter quite unabashed.</p>

<p>Presently the fire-proof curtain went up, the lights were
raised, and the band straggled in and began to tune their
fiddles. The conductor followed, a fat little German with a
bald head which shone like a large ostrich egg. He faced
the audience and bowed two or three times to their applause;
then, turning round, he tapped the music stand sharply with
his baton, and the first phrase was drawn slowly out on the
’cellos.</p>

<p>With the end of the overture the lights were turned down,
and the curtain rose on the lonely Faust, seated before a
skull, an hour-glass, and a large book, in his study. I had
already forgotten Owen, George, and everything but what I
saw before me. I was surprised to find that this old, grey-bearded
man, who looked, in the dimness, like an Albert
Durer print, had a fresh, strong, tenor voice. Outside I
heard the singing of the peasants; then followed the rage
and despair of Faust, and, in a flaming red light, the apparition
of Mephistopheles. Faust pleaded for his lost youth,
and Mephistopheles tempted him; the wall of the study
suddenly dissolved like a mist, and the vision of Margaret,
seated at her spinning-wheel, rose before the unhappy
philosopher; and the swinging, sensual phrase, repeated
again and again in the orchestra, lulled me to a dreamy
languor.</p>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Faust.</i>—“Heavenly vision!”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Mephistopheles.</i>—“Shall she love thee?”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="noi">There could be but one answer, and I saw Faust yield to
the tempter; I saw his rejuvenescence; and a triumphant
duet between them brought the act to a close.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span></p>

<p>I had become lost in this appealing melodrama, and
though my mood was broken in the next act, in the third
act, in the celebrated garden scene, it was revived and
intensified. The sugary sweetness of the music had an
almost hypnotic effect upon me, for I had never heard it till
now, and the ecstatic sensuality of the duet rapt me into a
world of love, where everything else was forgotten. It was
all utterly new to me; it thrilled me; it drowned me in
erotic dreams that swept me onward like the waves of the
sea; and through all, subconsciously, as I listened and
watched, I was carrying on another love-making of my
own, with which Faust and Margaret had nothing to do.
Through the next two acts I followed more closely the
fortunes of the unhappy heroine, not without a naïve
wonder why so much tragedy, so much remorse, should
attend on what appeared to me—but for the intervention of
the devil—a quite natural and straightforward courtship.
For some reason, possibly the fault of the libretto, more
probably because I could only catch about half the words,
I could not discover wherein lay the secret of the trouble,
nor why the lovers did not get married. I accepted the
situation however: I accepted, I think, everything but the
absurd “Soldiers’ Chorus,” and the death-scene of Valentine.
This latter nearly made me sick at the time, though I
forgot all about it when the curtain rose to reveal the
wretched Margaret in prison. With enthusiasm I watched
her reject her lover and the demon, and fling herself on her
knees to pour out her soul in a prayer which finished on the
high B. At last I saw her released from all the ills of
life, her body stretched on the miserable straw bed. And
with that the walls of the prison rolled back, and I had a
vision of her soul being borne to heaven by angels. It is
true those white-clad, flaxen-haired creatures, with glistening
wings and golden crowns, bore a not remote resemblance
to several of the livelier persons I had seen mingling with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
the soldiers and students at an earlier stage of the drama;
nevertheless I beheld them, in this pause on their way to
heaven, with respect, if not exactly veneration.</p>

<p>“I doubt they’re as near it now as they’ll ever be,” said
George, cynically, pulling his cap from his jacket pocket.</p>

<p>And out in the street, under the gas-lamp at the corner, I
had to submit to a deluge of criticism from both my companions.
I don’t know which I liked least, the scorn of
Owen, who revealed the tangible source of Margaret’s woes,
and would have had it adopted by the State, or, after Owen
had left, the ribald jibes of George, who found Faust a
poor creature, requiring a moon, a garden, a casket of
jewels, a devil, and several incantations, before he could
beguile an innocent rustic maiden who was already in love
with him. I resolved that I would go to the opera every
night that week, but that I would go alone. Between the
acts I had eagerly studied my programme, and the delightful,
unfamiliar, romantic names, “Tannhäuser,” “Il Trovatore,”
“Aida,” “Lohengrin,” were like syrens singing to
me through the darkness, with an irresistible and passionate
sweetness.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV</h2>
</div>


<p>I went to the opera every night that week, as I had planned
to do, but the edge of my appetite was blunted, and, save
in the case of “Tannhäuser,” and of “Lohengrin,” I was
disappointed. I had already become more critical, and I
now doubted if “Faust” were the admirable work I had
fancied it.</p>

<p>One evening there came a letter for me, and, when I
opened the envelope, I found inside a card which told me
that Miss L. Gill and Master E. Gill would be “at home” on
Friday, the 23rd of December. My own name was written
at the top of the card. In the bottom left-hand corner
was the word “Dancing,” followed by the numerals 8–12;
and in the corner opposite were four mysterious letters—“R.S.V.P.”</p>

<p>I knew it to be an invitation to a party, but “R.S.V.P.”
was puzzling. Neither Uncle George nor Aunt Margaret
could throw any light upon these symbols, though Uncle
George pondered over the card half the evening, as if it
had been a kind of magazine competition. Miss Izzy
probably would have known, but Miss Izzy had gone, and
would not be back till to-morrow morning, whereas I
had a keen conviction that action should be taken
to-night.</p>

<p>“Who are they?” Uncle George asked, referring to the
Gills.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span></p>

<p>“Mr. Gill is a solicitor. Owen Gill is in my classes at
school.”</p>

<p>Uncle George examined the card anew, bringing this
fresh light to bear on it. He held it at arm’s length, and
then put on his glasses and peered at it through them.
“Miss L. Gill and Master E. Gill,” he read aloud slowly
and solemnly.</p>

<p>I laughed. “They’re Owen’s young sister and brother,”
I explained.</p>

<p>“A solicitor. I suppose he will have some letters after
his name,” said Uncle George, weakly.</p>

<p>“Oh, they’re not those,” I answered, impatiently. It
seemed to me that everybody was very stupid.</p>

<p>“R.S.V.P.” Uncle George threw out thoughtfully.
He turned the card round and examined the back.</p>

<p>“Reply soon: very pressing,” suggested George.</p>

<p>His father looked at him doubtfully, and laid the card
on the table. “It can’t be so pressing,” he said, glancing
at the calendar, “when it’s a fortnight off.”</p>

<p>“You see they have to make sure he’s coming before
they ask anybody else,” George explained. “Rippin’
spread: veal pie.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you think that funny,” I broke in; whereupon
George, seeing I was inclined to be cross, kept
it up.</p>

<p>“Royal spree: von’t you partake? Refined soirée:
veather permittin’. That’s it, da, right enough; you can
leave the card by.”</p>

<p>But Uncle George continued to regard it searchingly,
glancing at me every now and again over his spectacles.</p>

<p>Nothing was done that night, and in the morning, before
school, I approached Miss Izzy on the subject; though
when I saw her examine the card almost as carefully as
the others had done, my faith in her sank.</p>

<p>“You’ll have to answer on a card,” said Miss Izzy,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
loftily, having at any rate settled the first point, and waving
aside the sheet of note paper I held in my hand.</p>

<p>“I haven’t got one.”</p>

<p>“There’s a box of them in the shop somewhere. They’ve
been there since the dear knows when. Nobody ever asks
for cards.” She hunted about in a drawer under the
counter, and at length succeeded in finding the box.
Without breaking the pink paper band that held the
cards together she carefully extracted one from the
bundle. I took it and dipped my pen in the ink and
waited.</p>

<p>“Just answer it in the usual way,” said Miss Izzy, offhandedly,
with the air of one who dashes off at least half
a dozen such communications every day.</p>

<p>“I don’t know the usual way,” I confessed.</p>

<p>Miss Izzy aggravatingly paused to shake out a paper
lamp-shade. Then she attended to a little boy who came
in to buy a “Deadwood Dick” tale.</p>

<p>“Tell me what to say,” I begged, humbly.</p>

<p>“Mr. Peter Waring,” dictated Miss Izzy, with much
dignity; and I wrote “Mr. Peter Waring,” in terror all
the time of making a blot.</p>

<p>Miss Izzy glanced over my shoulder. “You’ve begun
too high up,” she said, reassuringly. Then, as I made a
movement to tear the card, “Oh, it’ll do.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Peter Waring begs to thank Miss L. Gill and Master
E. Gill for their very kind invitation.”</p>

<p>The shop-bell had rung again. It was the little boy
back to change his story for another he had discovered in
the window, and which it took Miss Izzy hours to extract.
“Corduroy Charlie,” she murmured, as she handed it
across the counter. It was the title of the work.</p>

<p>“Yes?” I said, trying not to appear impatient.</p>

<p>Miss Izzy came back to my affairs. “Oh! what have
you got?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span></p>

<p>“Mr. Peter Waring begs to thank Miss L. Gill and Master
E. Gill for their very kind invitation——”</p>

<p>“Invitation.... And will be very pleased to accept
same for the date mentioned.”</p>

<p>“Yes?”</p>

<p>“That’s all. Don’t be signing your name, stupid!”</p>

<p>I hastily checked myself.</p>

<p>“What do those letters in the corner mean?” I asked
timidly. “I suppose I oughtn’t to put them on mine?”</p>

<p>“Of course not. They’re French, and mean they want
an answer.”</p>

<p>I read over what I had written and thanked Miss Izzy,
but secretly I was not satisfied. I felt sure there was
something wrong somewhere. It did not read well. I put
it in an envelope, however, and posted it, though immediately
afterwards I became more unhappy about it than
ever. I made a mental note to ask Mrs. Carroll for information
when I was at home at Christmas.</p>

<p>I had been asked to the Gills’ for eight o’clock, and at
half-past six I began to dress. After posting my acceptance
my next care had been in regard to the clothes I should
wear. There is no doubt greatly increased opportunities
had tended to develop in me a latent dandyism. At all
events I took the matter of my dress quite seriously, and
had very definite ideas in regard to it. I went to the best
tailor in town, my bills were sent on to Mrs. Carroll, and
that was all I knew about them. I tried to get the soft
greys and blacks and whites I admired in old Spanish and
Dutch portraits, with perhaps a colour-note of olive green
in my neck-tie, but always with the tones kept low and
harmonious. Dandyism certainly, but it was in its way
merely an expression of those same sensibilities that enabled
me to see the charm of the pictures I have mentioned;
that is to say, it was not based on any feeling of personal
vanity, for I had no illusions in regard to my beauty. So,
in this particular instance, I took immense pains to see
that everything should be exactly right, and at the same
time pleasing to myself. The cloth I had chosen was of
the very blackest and finest and softest. Each garment
had to be fitted on me till I could find no fault in it. The
broad braid down the sides of my trousers seemed to me
perfectly decorative. It was really in its use of linen that
modern dress most conspicuously failed: what would Franz<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
Hals or Velasquez have thought of the stiff, glazed collar
convention obliged me to wear?</p>

<p>When I had finished dressing I looked at myself critically
in the inadequate glass, beside which I had set two or three
candles, standing in pools of their own grease. It seemed
to me that the peculiar, sullen expression of my face, caused
by the formation of my forehead and the shape of my mouth,
must always create an unfavourable impression. If I could
recognise it myself, it would probably be a great deal more
striking to other people. It disappeared when I smiled,
but as soon as I stopped smiling it came back again.</p>

<p>I went downstairs and strutted about before Miss Izzy
and little Alice, that they might admire my fine feathers,
and it was only when I reached the Gills that every other
feeling was swallowed up in a horrible shyness.</p>

<p>The whole house was brilliantly lit up, and I was shown
to a room already half-filled with boys, who were removing
their overcoats, putting on their dancing shoes, talking and
laughing perfectly easily, just as if the most frightful ordeal
were not staring them in the face. Evidently they all
knew each other quite well, whereas I knew nobody. Owen
came up, indeed, and spoke to me, but forsook me almost
immediately, as people were arriving every minute, two or
three of them, I observed, quite grown-up. I wished Owen
would come back. When I saw a boy I knew slightly and
heartily disliked, I was ready to welcome him as the oldest
and dearest of friends, but, not being in my solitary condition,
he merely nodded to me, and went over to join a
group at the other side of the room. I was left standing
by myself, not knowing what to do; and all the time fresh
guests were arriving, and I felt I was in the way,
but could not summon up courage to make a movement.
I now bitterly regretted having been such a fool as to come.
I noticed several other boys with whom I had a casual
acquaintance at school, but beyond nodding they paid no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
attention to me, and I became filled with rage against them
and against Owen himself. Then I heard a voice saying
over my shoulder, “If you’re ready you may as well come
upstairs.”</p>

<p>It was Owen, and I followed him obediently. I passed
a group of boys loitering outside an open door, and found
myself all at once in a large room. The light at first half-dazzled
me. With a heart furiously beating I was led up
to a tall, slight lady in black, who was standing near the
fireplace. This was Owen’s mother. I shook hands with
her, and with his father, and with one of his elder sisters.
But when this was accomplished I was again in that horrible
position of not knowing what to do and being afraid to
move. Owen had once more deserted me. All about me
were a crowd of brightly-dressed girls, chattering and
laughing among themselves, and pretending not to look
at me. The boys, with whom I would have liked now to
be back again, were hovering near the door, and I tried to
screw up my courage to the point of crossing the room.
Then somebody—I think it was Owen’s sister—gave me a
programme. I stood clasping it tightly in my hand. It
seemed to me now unthinkably idiotic that I should voluntarily
have placed myself in this position of torture, when
all I had had to do was to refuse the invitation and stay
at home. At that moment a lady to whom I had not been
introduced spoke to me, though I was too much upset to
hear what she said. She had a pleasant smile, a voice soft
and attractive, and she asked me my name, and told me
I must get some partners. Many of the other boys, I
noticed, had begun to ask for dances, and were scribbling
down names in their programmes. My new friend bore
me off to a fair-haired, fair-skinned, demure-looking maiden
in a pink, fleecy dress, and introduced me. Unfortunately,
at this point, one of the grown-up persons, a tall young
man, called out, “Annie, half a mo,” and my protectress<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
turned away, leaving me to make my own advances. I
could do nothing. How could I ask this wretched girl to
dance with me when I had never danced in my life? For
an agonizing moment I stood there; then I stammered
out something, turned on my heel abruptly, and walked
away.</p>

<p>It was dreadful. Before me I saw a conservatory, the
door of which was open, and I escaped into it as my only
refuge. I felt utterly miserable. It occurred to me to
slip out quietly and go home, but to do that I should have
to cross the room, and somebody would be sure to pounce
upon me. Besides, what would the McAllisters think?
The first dance had commenced, and I saw that my golden-haired
maiden had found another partner. He happened
to be one of the boys I knew, and I was certain she would
tell him what I had done, and that everybody at school
would get to know about it.</p>

<p>In the midst of the dance the lady called Annie bore
straight down upon me, having detected my hiding-place.
But she did not seem angry; on the contrary, she was
laughing. She threaded her way among the palms, while
I felt my face becoming purple.</p>

<p>“What do you mean by running away like that from the
partners I choose for you?” she asked gaily. “Elsie told
me you wouldn’t ask her to dance, and she says it’s my fault,
that I made you come when you didn’t want to.”</p>

<p>“I can’t dance,” I answered huskily. Nevertheless,
Elsie’s explanation of my conduct, in spite of the fact that
it redoubled its rudeness, gave me relief.</p>

<p>The “Annie” lady looked at me, still laughing. Then
she said very kindly, “Oh, don’t mind; it really doesn’t
matter in the least. Come and dance with me.”</p>

<p>“But I can’t,” I muttered, “I never tried in my life.”</p>

<p>“Well, come and talk to me then, and we can watch the
others.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span></p>

<p>She led me back into the room. She asked me all kinds
of questions about myself, and very soon I was chattering
away as if I had known her all my life. I had forgotten
what an extremely small boy I had been only ten minutes
ago, as I looked about me boldly, and gave “Annie” my
opinion on all kinds of things.</p>

<p>We talked of the opera, and when she told me she preferred
the “Trovatore” to “Lohengrin” I thought her
taste very crude. All the same I liked her. She laughed in
a nice way, and was interested in everything you said to
her. I pulled up my trousers a little so that my delicate
silk socks should be more visible. As I glanced round the
room I decided that I was much better dressed than anybody
there, and this conviction increased my confidence. I would
have liked to ask “Annie” what she thought of me from
this point of view, but instead, she inquired if I was fond of
reading. I replied in the affirmative, and she asked me if I
had read “Tom Brown’s School-days.” I again said,
“Yes,” and asked her if she had read “Anna Karénine.”</p>

<p>“What a curious book for you to get hold of! I should
have thought you would have preferred ‘The Coral Island,’
or ‘Midshipman Easy.’ Those are the kind of books <em>my</em>
brothers like. That is one of my brothers there, that fat
ugly boy with red hair, dancing with the little girl in white.”</p>

<p>I inspected the brother. “‘Anna Karénine’ is a fine
book,” I answered. “Why didn’t she ask for the divorce
at once, do you think? I mean as soon as she went away
with Wronsky?”</p>

<p>Out of the tail of my eye I saw the young man who had
before interfered between us again approaching. She saw
him too, and immediately called out, “Bertie, we’re discussing
‘Anna Karénine.’ I’m sure you haven’t read it.”</p>

<p>We didn’t really discuss it, for she changed the subject
directly afterwards, without even having answered my
question, and Bertie, who I heard later was a football<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
player of great renown, asked me if my school was going to
win the cup this year. The first square dance “Annie”
insisted on my dancing with her, and, so far as I could
judge, I shuffled through it all right. After that she left
me to my own resources, and I returned to Bertie. There
was something between Bertie and her, I believed. I was
sure he had only come because she had told him she was
going to be there to help to look after the kids. Bertie had
danced all the dances up to this one, but he now told me
that if he didn’t have a smoke he should die, and asked me
to come to the billiard-room with him. We played a
hundred up, Bertie going two to my one, but I beat him, for
I had often knocked the balls about on the table at Derryaghy,
though there was rarely anybody to have a game with.
Bertie said I should make a good player if I practised, and
he showed me a lot of strokes. He was very jolly and I
liked him. Presently he asked me if I didn’t want some
supper, and we went downstairs. Refreshments had been
going on all the evening, but the room happened to be empty
when we came in. There was a great deal of lemonade and
stuff, but Bertie secured some champagne, and by the time
I had had two glasses I began to feel extremely comfortable
and jolly. Bertie’s jokes were twice as good as they had
been before, and my own conversation suddenly acquired
an interest and brilliancy that made me want to talk as
much as possible. After my third glass Bertie suggested I
should try Apollinaris, but I refused. The room had
somehow by this time got full of people. Bertie told me to
keep quiet, but just then he was called away, and I was left
to finish my supper alone.</p>

</div>


<p>When I got to my feet to go back to the dancing-room,
everything swayed before my eyes, and I held on to the
back of my chair till I had steadied myself. I felt now as
bold as a lion, and as soon as I clapped eyes on Elsie, my
golden-haired maiden whom I had insulted earlier in the
evening, I determined to apologize. I went up to her,
looking neither to right nor left, and placing myself in front
of her asked her to give me the next dance.</p>

<p>She looked at me somewhat timidly, and said she was
engaged already, showing me her programme. I at once
stroked the name out.</p>

<p>“Now,” I said, “let’s go and sit down somewhere. He’ll
never find us.”</p>

<p>She hesitated, but only for a second or two. Then she
rose and put her hand lightly on my arm.</p>

<p>“Don’t you think it’s awfully hot in here?” I went on,
with amazing aplomb. “Besides, we have to hide any
way, haven’t we?”</p>

<p>But outside, the landing was full of people. I glanced at
the staircase before us, seeming to lead up into regions of
dim coolness and solitude, and proposed we should try to
find some place on the next floor.</p>

<p>There was indeed a seat there, in the dusk, but Elsie
looked at it with misgiving. “I don’t think we should
have come so high up,” she said. “I’m sure we’re not meant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
to. I think we’d better go down: nobody else is coming
up here.”</p>

<p>“But isn’t that just the reason we came? It’s all right.
If anybody else does come we won’t be the only ones, and
if they don’t who’s to know anything about us?”</p>

<p>I don’t know whether Elsie was convinced by this
sophistry, but at any rate she sat down. “I want to
apologize to you,” I began softly. “Are you very angry
with me?” I was surprised at the amount of expression I
was able to throw into my voice, and I had a delightful
feeling of not caring a straw what I said or did. It was
fairly evident that Elsie rather admired the mood I was
displaying, though I could see she was slightly puzzled by it.</p>

<p>“No,” she answered simply. “I knew you were shy.”
She lifted her innocent grey eyes to mine, and it came over
me, very intensely, that she was extremely pretty. She
looked very soft and demure in her fleecy pink dress, and
with her hands folded in her lap.</p>

<p>“Do you think I’m shy now?” I asked, smiling.</p>

<p>“No,” she answered sweetly.</p>

<p>I couldn’t help laughing. At the same time I felt a sudden
tenderness for her, which it seemed most essential that I
should put into words.</p>

<p>“You’ve forgiven me then?” I went on.</p>

<p>She laughed. “What nonsense you talk. As if it
mattered.”</p>

<p>“It matters to me. Say you forgive me.”</p>

<p>“I won’t. There’s nothing to forgive.” She blushed
and looked down.</p>

<p>“Say it,” I persisted, bending towards her. “If you
don’t I’ll think you dislike me.”</p>

<p>She kept her eyes downcast, and I drew closer still.</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“I don’t dislike you,” she whispered.</p>

<p>I kissed her. She blushed a deep delightful blush, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
did not move away. The swinging melody of a waltz rose
up to us through the dim cool light.</p>

<p>“Are you angry now?” I asked.</p>

<p>She shook her head. I put my arms round her, and as I
felt her yielding I had a strong strange pleasure. I held her
close to me, kissing her again and again, while she closed
her eyes like a cat that is being stroked. For a moment I
felt her lips touch mine, then she struggled away from me,
and without looking back hurried downstairs.</p>

<p>I followed, but before I could rejoin her Owen caught me
by the arm. “I’ve been looking for you everywhere. I’ve
hardly seen you all the evening. What have you been
up to?”</p>

<p>I laughed.</p>

<p>He looked at me, slightly perplexed. “What is there so
amusing?” he inquired.</p>

<p>But I didn’t try to explain.</p>

<p>“What is the matter?” Owen went on, gazing at me.</p>

<p>“Nothing,” I answered.</p>

<p>“Come on upstairs: it’s cooler there. There’s a seat on
the next lobby.”</p>

<p>“Is there?” I replied, as I followed him.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII">CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>
</div>


<p>“I hope you haven’t been awfully bored?” was Owen’s first
remark after we sat down.</p>

<p>“No; I think it’s a lovely party.”</p>

<p>There was a silence.</p>

<p>“What <em>is</em> the matter, Peter?” Owen asked
again.</p>

<p>“Nothing, Owen, except natural excitement. Don’t be
suspicious.”</p>

<p>Owen looked unconvinced, but he decided to change the
subject. “Do you know the part of the book that I really
like best? It is where Levine mows the meadows with the
peasants.”</p>

<p>I knew we were back again at “Anna Karénine,” but I
couldn’t bring my mind to bear upon it.</p>

<p>“That is the real kind of life,” Owen pursued, “where
all is simple, and natural; where there are no balls and
clubs and lies and all the rest. I hate towns. I shall always
live somewhere in the country.”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t suit everybody,” I brilliantly observed.</p>

<p>“It doesn’t suit people like Anna and Wronsky.”</p>

<p>“You’re always down on poor Anna.”</p>

<p>“She’s not poor. She had every chance to be happy.
Why couldn’t she have been content to be friends with
Wronsky? All the rest was pure selfishness.”</p>

<p>“You don’t understand,” I replied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span></p>

<p>Owen hated to be told this. “Understand what?” he
demanded, impatiently.</p>

<p>“The kind of love Anna and Wronsky had for each other.”</p>

<p>“Why, then, as soon as she goes to live with Wronsky,
does she begin to talk so much of her love for her son? I
don’t like her. It seems to me that she deliberately spoiled
the lives of her husband and her son for her own gratification.”</p>

<p>“She didn’t spoil her son’s life. He was only a little boy.”</p>

<p>“But she forsook him.”</p>

<p>“You don’t understand,” I was obliged to repeat.
“You never <em>will</em> understand.”</p>

<p>“Do you want to stick up for that sort of thing?”</p>

<p>“I’m not sticking up for it; but I don’t think it’s the
kind of thing a person can accept or refuse just as if it were
an invitation to a party. If you knew anything about it you
wouldn’t say they might have been content to be friends.”</p>

<p>“And do you like the way she makes fun of her husband
to her lover?”</p>

<p>“What has that to do with it?”</p>

<p>“Even when she is making her confession to her husband
she thinks only of herself. She tells him that she hates
him. It does not occur to her that he can have any feelings,
because his manner is stiff and he has a habit of cracking
his finger-joints.”</p>

<p>“It didn’t much matter how she made her confession.”</p>

<p>“It did. She needn’t have been brutal.”</p>

<p>“Oh, she wasn’t brutal.”</p>

<p>“And all the lies?”</p>

<p>“But you never seem to think of her situation!”</p>

<p>“I do. She deliberately brought about her own situation,
after having been warned by her husband. You admire
her simply because she loves Wronsky; but there is
nothing very wonderful about that kind of love.”</p>

<p>“I never said I admired her; I said I understood her.
If she sacrificed her husband, she sacrificed herself too.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span></p>

<p>“Yes—and her lover, and her friend Kitty, and her son,
and everything. Levine’s brother, who drinks himself to
death, also sacrifices himself. And Yavshine, who gambles
away all his fortune.”</p>

<p>“You don’t see any difference?”</p>

<p>“I don’t see anything fine in the kind of love Anna felt.
And when she says she won’t have any more children, it
seems to me that it becomes simply disgusting. Have you
thought what it means?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I know what it means,” I answered sulkily. Owen
had managed to completely alter my mood, and I no longer
felt pleased with myself or pleased with him. I was irritated
because he seemed, now as always, to try to judge what was a
matter of emotion by reasoning about it.</p>

<p>“If you had ever loved anybody,” I said, “it would make
you look at such things differently.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps I mightn’t see them any clearer for that.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps not. But to judge human beings you require
first of all to understand something about human nature.”</p>

<p>“Understand! You’re always harping on that! It’s a
very cheap way of arguing. Why should I think <em>you</em> understand?”</p>

<p>“Because I have felt what we are talking about, and you
haven’t.” I suddenly grew violently excited. “You don’t
know what it is to care for a person so that nothing else in
the world matters, so that it is like a kind of sickness, preventing
you even from sleeping. You know nothing, have
felt nothing, and yet you bring out your miserable little
catechism arguments and pretend to pronounce judgment.
I’d rather have a man who had committed all the crimes on
the earth than one of those cold, fishy, reasonable creatures
you admire, who never did anything wrong, and never made
anybody happy.”</p>

<p>Owen looked at me in amazement, which is indeed hardly
surprising. But suddenly my excitement passed, and I felt<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
only a passion of home-sickness and regret. It swept over
me like a heavy, resistless rush of water. All that was here
around me grew black as night. I longed to get away from
everything that could even remind me of my life of the past
few months. I seemed to have a sudden bright light in
which I saw myself clearly. In these few months I had
deteriorated, the quality even of my love for Katherine had
deteriorated; it had become less of the spirit, more of an
obsession. And now, as I stood there before Owen, I seemed
to hear the soft breaking of waves, infinitely peaceful,
and I had a vision of my own bedroom, where I went to
sleep, and wakened up, with the low sound of the sea in my
ears. I said good-night hurriedly to the astonished Owen.
I told him I was sorry for speaking as I had done, but that
I would explain it all to him another time; only now I must
go. I ran downstairs to the cloak-room, and a few minutes
later left the house, without having said good-night to
Mrs. Gill.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>When I reached home I let myself in quietly with a latch-key,
but as I was undressing George wakened up and began
to ask me about the party. I did not feel in the least like
going to sleep, and after I had got into bed we lay talking.
Presently George got up and lit the gas, which I had turned
out. I saw him go to the hiding-place he had shown me on
the night of my arrival, and again take from it that mysterious
bundle of photographs. He came over and sat down
on the side of my bed.</p>

<p>“I don’t want to see them,” I said, pushing him away;
but he may have detected a note of weakness in my voice,
for he only laughed.</p>

<p>“Don’t be a fool,” he answered brutally. “I’m not going
to do you any harm.”</p>

<p>He drew them from the envelope and showed them to me,
one by one, while the gas flamed and flared above our heads.</p>

</div>


<p>Owen stepped back off the foot-board on to the platform.</p>

<p>“Good-bye,” I said, leaning out of the carriage window.
“There’s no use your waiting till the train starts. I hope
you’ll have decent holidays.”</p>

<p>He smiled. “I’m sure I will. I wish, all the same, you
were going to be with me. I thought of it, but then I
thought you would rather go home.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I said.</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t you really? Don’t you want to go home?”</p>

<p>“Yes, of course. Why do you ask?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. You don’t seem, perhaps, quite so keen
as you were——”</p>

<p>Owen still waited, but I had taken my seat.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll see you again in a fortnight,” he went on,
cheerfully. “Write to me, won’t you, if you aren’t too
busy?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>Another pause followed, while Owen looked up and down
the platform. He seemed to me extraordinarily happy.</p>

<p>“Well, good-bye again,” he said.</p>

<p>“Good-bye.”</p>

<p>And this time the guard’s whistle blew, the train jolted
forward with a clatter of coupling-irons, and then glided
steadily on. I waved my hand to Owen, catching a last
glimpse of his bright, animated face before I settled down<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
to the indifferent contemplation of the staler, and coarser-looking
persons who shared my compartment. What I had
been looking forward to for many weeks had come to pass;
I was on my way home; outwardly nothing was wanting;
yet not even the thought of seeing Mrs. Carroll again seemed
to have power to awaken that joy I had anticipated, though
she had written to ask me to spend part of my holidays with
her, and I tried now to think of some scheme by which to
make this part as large as possible.</p>

<p>I looked at the people opposite; I looked out of the
window; I turned the pages of <cite>Punch’s Almanac</cite>, which
Owen had bought for me at the bookstall. Then I shut my
eyes and tried to doze.</p>

<p>When the train drew in at the station I saw my father
standing on the platform. Somehow, I had not expected
him to be there, and he upset my calculations. I opened the
carriage door, and as I shook hands with him I realized how
much easier it is to make plans than to carry them out, and
hoped Mrs. Carroll herself had approached him on the matter
of my going to Derryaghy. His careworn, anxious face was
lit by a smile as he asked me how I was. A porter meanwhile
had secured my box and was wheeling it on a truck
along the platform. But, as we walked behind him, that old
stupid feeling of constraint had already begun to take
possession of me, and my replies to my father’s questions
sounded, for all I could do to the contrary, stiff, and even
reluctant.</p>

<p>It was after one o’clock and dinner was ready when we
reached the house.</p>

<p>“The train must have been late,” I remarked, indifferently,
as we sat down; and then I could think of nothing
further to say.</p>

<p>It struck me that my father was older and dimmer and
shabbier than I had remembered him. He presented the
picture, drab and dreary, of perfectly achieved failure, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
I found myself looking out for all his old habits, the peculiar
noises he made with his nose, his fashion of smacking his lips.
I noticed that his hands were not very clean, and that his
coat looked as if he had brushed his hair over it. These
things struck me all the more forcibly, somehow, because I
tried to think how superficial and unimportant they were.
I had a vision of the solitary meals he must have taken for
the past four months, and I was sorry for him, though
subconsciously, at the same time, I was considering how
soon it would do for me to mention my proposed visit to
Derryaghy.</p>

<p>After dinner he asked me what I wanted to do. “It is
nice and dry for walking,” he said. “We have had quite a
hard frost.”</p>

<p>It sounded as if he intended coming with me, a thing he
seldom or never did.</p>

<p>“I was thinking of going up to Derryaghy,” I answered,
with an assumption of carelessness that did not prevent my
noting the immediate change that came into his face.</p>

<p>“Had you planned anything?” I asked hastily.</p>

<p>“No, no.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you would like to go for a walk?”</p>

<p>“No, no. Please yourself,” he replied.</p>

<p>So I went up to Derryaghy, with a guilty sense that I had
hurt his feelings. It was a pity that I should have begun in
this fashion; that I could not, for once, have been cheerfully
and spontaneously unselfish, but my longing to get back to
my old haunts was intense, and I yielded to it.</p>

<p>After all, when I reached Derryaghy, Mrs. Carroll was not
there. She had left a message for me to say that she had
been obliged to go up to town, but that she hoped I should
be able to dine with her at the usual hour. I wandered out
into the winter woods, beautiful with the strange and delicate
beauty of naked trees. I loved this place really with a
kind of passion, and I was glad my father was not here, glad<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
that I was alone. Dark slender branches traced fantastic
arabesques against the grey sky above my head. The black-
and silver-stemmed birches gave the note that was carried
out through all the colouring. Only the fir-trees, laurels, and
an occasional holly-tree, were green. I loved the woods in
winter; they seemed to me to have then a peculiar grace
they did not possess at any other season. And the wind
whistled so hollowly in the leafless trees, and the darting
birds were so black against the sky, and all was so silent and
solitary, with a sort of frozen loveliness, that I could conceive
of nothing more beautiful even in the green pomp and
splendour of summer. And behind everything was a vision
of long, lamp-lit, fire-lit evenings, with dreamy, delicious
books. The leaves of the laurels and holly were coated
with frost; the dead fronds of the bracken were a dull
brown; here and there the sombre colouring was splashed
with the red leaves of brambles. There was a hint of
approaching snow in the air, there was almost a silence of
snow, and I seemed to feel it drawing closer to me through
the cold, remote sky. The ground was hard as iron. Sometimes
a single leaf, pallid and faded, trembled still at the end
of a twig, but almost all the leaves that were going to fall
had fallen long ago. I saw the flash of fur, brown and white,
in the frozen grass, but Tony, who followed at my heels, was
indifferent to rabbits.</p>

<p>It was dusk when I returned. A servant preceded me
into the drawing-room, and lit the lamps, and made up the
fire, throwing on another log or two. I sat down in one of
the big, soft armchairs and began to turn over Christmas
numbers—the <cite>Graphic</cite>, the <cite>London News</cite>, <cite>Holly Leaves</cite>—looking
at Caldecott’s, Sambourne’s, and Fred Barnard’s
drawings. I began to read a story by Bret Harte. It was
extraordinarily nice to be here again. This dear old house,
how I loved it! The huge wood fire, the roomy depth of
my armchair, the soft, thick carpet, all the surroundings<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
of pleasantness and comfort, appealed to me after
my prolonged and reluctant experience of the McAllisters.
The fragrant China tea that was brought in to me tasted
more deliciously than anything I had ever tasted before,
and when I had finished my story (“The Chatelaine of Burnt
Ridge,” I think it was called) and the servant had cleared
away the tea-things, I sat and dozed.</p>

<p>I had asked after Miss Dick, but of course she had gone
home for Christmas. I was really to be alone this time—just
myself and Mrs. Carroll.</p>

<p>As I sat there, looking into the fire, I felt that it would
have been nicer of me to have gone home on this, the evening
of my arrival, but six o’clock, our tea hour, had struck ten
minutes ago, and still I had not budged from my chair.
Curious thoughts, thoughts I should have been ashamed to
tell anybody, came to me unbidden, and for the first time. It
made a tremendous difference just who happened to be one’s
father, I reflected; and I thought of how the Dales were Mrs.
Carroll’s nearest relatives. “She likes me better than
anybody else,” I said to myself. “If I were by myself she
would adopt me. All this—the house—everything will
belong one day to somebody else; but to whom?...
The house?” ... And I remembered she did not care
for Gerald, and that Gerald did not in the least try to make
her alter her opinion. Probably he had only come over last
summer because his people had insisted on it. All at once I
realized that these speculations were not particularly charming,
and tried to put them from me. At the same time I
heard the sharp sound of a horse’s hoofs on the frozen
ground, then the crunch of gravel under carriage wheels,
and I knew Mrs. Carroll had returned.</p>

<p>She opened the door and came straight to me, smiling
and holding out her hand. “You’ve grown so big,” she
said, lifting her thick veil, “I don’t know whether you want
to be kissed or not, but I think I’ll risk it.” She kissed me,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
and then held me at arm’s length to look at me. She moved
me a little so that the lamp-light fell on my face. “My
dear child,” she asked, with a sudden anxiety, “aren’t you
well? How did you get those black lines under your eyes?
You can’t be getting enough sleep. Have you been working
too hard?”</p>

<p>“No,” I answered, “but I was up late last night.”</p>

<p>“You must be more careful: your health is infinitely
more important than any wretched examination. Well, at
all events, I’m very glad to see you.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>A couple of hours later, after dinner, she again took up
the subject of my appearance, which evidently did not
satisfy her, though I assured her there was nothing the matter.</p>

<p>“You’ve altered,” she said, thoughtfully. “It isn’t only
that you’ve grown, but you, somehow, look older. Do you
get your meals properly? I expect you stop to play after
school instead of coming home to your dinner!”</p>

<p>I changed the subject as soon as I could by asking after
the Dales. “Will they be here next summer?”</p>

<p>“If you would like it I daresay we can manage it. In
fact I invited Katherine for Christmas, but she couldn’t
come.”</p>

<p>“I hope they will come in the summer.”</p>

<p>I inquired after all the other people I could think of: I
felt interested in everything that had happened since I had
gone away. Then I sat quiet, and quite suddenly, when I
thought she had forgotten all about it, Mrs. Carroll said,
“I wish you would tell me, Peter, just what is troubling
you.”</p>

<p>“But there is nothing,” I answered, smiling. “I was
only thinking how nice it was to be back here again.”</p>

<p>“Remember you are to come to stay for a few days, before
the end of your holidays. You must stay at least a week.
When have you to go back?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span></p>

<p>“On the eighth.”</p>

<p>“And those people you are with—the What-do-you-call-ems—how
do you like them?”</p>

<p>“The McAllisters?” I hesitated. “Not very much.”</p>

<p>“Do they look after you properly?”</p>

<p>“Oh yes.”</p>

<p>“I think I’ll come and see you there. I would have gone
before this, only your father didn’t want it.”</p>

<p>“I’d rather you didn’t,” I said.</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>I had no answer and she went on: “I must call and have
a talk with your father before you go back.”</p>

<p>“It won’t do any good so far as that is concerned. He
wants me to be there. Aunt Margaret is his sister.”</p>

<p>“I know that, but you’d rather be by yourself, wouldn’t
you? I can see there is something you don’t like.”</p>

<p>“My father wouldn’t let me. He has some idea about a
home influence—but I told you before, and of course he told
you himself.”</p>

<p>“Home fiddlesticks! You’d have been far better at a
good boarding-school. This, it seems to me, is neither one
thing nor another. I must speak to him.”</p>

<p>“There is no use really,” I said, for I knew that if she
were to take the matter up again it might end in my not even
being allowed to come to stay at Derryaghy next week.</p>

<p>“Your father is far too anxious about you. If there had
been two or three more of you it would have been much
better.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t that.” I waited a while before I brought it out:
“He doesn’t trust me.”</p>

<p>“Doesn’t trust you? In what way doesn’t he trust
you?”</p>

<p>“In every way. He thinks I’m inclined naturally to—to
do things—”</p>

<p>“To do things? What sort of things?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span></p>

<p>“To be bad,” I said abruptly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carroll stared at me. “Nonsense, child,” she
answered. “I don’t know what can have put such an idea
into your head!”</p>

<p>“<em>He</em> did,” I muttered. “There are times when I think
he may be right,” I went on dejectedly, “that he must surely
have some reason. I don’t know.... He is always
thinking about my mother.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Carroll had been on the point of speaking, but at this
she paused.</p>

<p>“I know nothing about her,” I pursued. “I can’t
remember her at all, and there is not even a photograph at
home. What <em>is</em> there? Do <em>you</em> know nothing?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Carroll hesitated. “Nothing,” she then said.
“Nothing more than you know yourself, Peter dear,” she
added.</p>

<p>“You have never heard? I should like to go to see her.”</p>

<p>“Yes?” There was a note of doubt in this monosyllable
which made me look up.</p>

<p>“I should like to judge for myself,” I continued, impetuously.
But the question was, or to Mrs. Carroll appeared to
be, an impossible one for us to discuss together, and she
made no reply.</p>

<p>“And how do you like your school?” she asked presently,
holding up a magazine between her face and the blazing
fire. “Tell me all about it—about all your friends and
everything you do.”</p>

<p>I began to tell her, giving, as I went along a kind of
rough, rambling account of my ordinary day. I told of
how I had come to know Owen; how the real thief had never
been discovered. I described Owen to her; I said he was
the only friend I had made. I told her of the party last
night, leaving out the episode of Elsie.</p>

<p>“It makes such a difference when you find somebody who
is more or less like yourself.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span></p>

<p>“I don’t think he is very like me,” I answered. “I
don’t think we’re a bit alike, but—” I tried to puzzle it out:
“I suppose we must have some things in common.”</p>

<p>“Tell me about him,” she encouraged me.</p>

<p>“He’s a very good chap,” I said lamely. Then, as this
didn’t in the least express my meaning: “I mean he’s very
straight, and decent, and all that. He’s not like anybody
else.”</p>

<p>“What is the difference?”</p>

<p>“Well, for one thing, he’s awfully serious. I don’t mean
dull—but serious about what things really mean and that
sort of thing.”</p>

<p>“Is he clever?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. He’s very simple.”</p>

<p>“And George—isn’t that his name? the name of your
cousin?—what is <em>he</em> like? Are you friends with him?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes.”</p>

<p>“Tell me about George too.”</p>

<p>“There’s nothing to tell. He’s in business. You
wouldn’t much care for him.”</p>

<p>“Why not? Don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, very well.” And it suddenly struck me as strange
that I did so, that I did not positively detest him.</p>

<p>“You do not seem enthusiastic. Is he not nice?”</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s all right. He’s nice enough, I daresay—just
as nice as I am.”</p>

<p>“Why won’t you tell me what is the matter, Peter?”</p>

<p>“There is nothing.”</p>

<p>“You haven’t done anything wrong, have you?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p>I closed my eyes for a minute as I leaned back in my
chair. A silence had fallen on the room with my last
words. Then suddenly my self-control deserted me, and
I hid my face against the arm of the chair, just as if I had
been a child.</p>

</div>


<p>It was a beautiful, clear, winter night when I walked home.
Over the low wall I looked out at the dark, smooth sea,
stretching away, almost black, save where the moonlight
touched it. I trailed my right hand on the wall as I walked,
heedless of the cold, though it was freezing keenly. The
tide was in, and the chill, listless splash of the small waves,
running through my thoughts, seemed to increase their
sadness. On the verge of the distant golf-links a ruddy
light from the big hotel shone out into the night.</p>

<p>As I turned up the Bryansford Road, I saw, in the moonlight,
my father standing leaning over the garden gate, and
behind him the house door was open. Unconsciously I
slackened my pace. He was looking for me, perhaps. He
must have already heard me, for the sound of my footsteps
rang out sharply on the hard road.</p>

<p>“Where have you been all this time?” he asked abruptly,
as I came up.</p>

<p>There was a hardness in his voice that, in my present
mood, I shrank from more than I should have from physical
violence. I knew he knew where I had been, and I thought
he might have let the matter pass. “I didn’t intend to
stay so late,” I said, apologetically, “but Mrs. Carroll had
gone up to town and left a message for me, asking me to
wait. After dinner she wanted me to tell her all I had been
doing since I left home.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span></p>

<p>“I hope you were more communicative than you were to
me. You hadn’t time, I suppose, to come back and say
you were staying. I waited tea for you for nearly an hour.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t think it mattered,” I mumbled. “I’m very
sorry. I thought you would understand.”</p>

<p>I had already climbed half a dozen stairs on my way to
bed, when my father called me back.</p>

<p>“Why are you rushing off like that, now?”</p>

<p>I hastily returned. “I was going to bed: I didn’t know
you wanted to sit up.” I went on into the parlour, where
there was a smoky fire in the grate, just large enough to
make you realize how cold it was, and on the table some
bread and butter, a jug of milk and a tumbler. I sat down
beside the fire.</p>

<p>“I’m not going to sit up; but I don’t want you to treat
your home as if it were an hotel, a place where you come
merely to sleep. I’ve no doubt things are more to your
taste at Derryaghy, but while this <em>is</em> your home, you must
try to make the best of it.”</p>

<p>I looked at my father helplessly, but I said nothing. I
had an uncomfortable vision of his sitting here all evening
by himself. If he would only make friends with somebody!
I wondered if he had been happy before mamma
went away.</p>

<p>“Seeing that it was your first day at home,” he went on,
putting down my silence to sulkiness, “you might at least
have been content to be out all the afternoon. Now that
we are on the subject, I had better let you know that Mrs.
Carroll asked me to allow you to spend part of your holidays
at Derryaghy, but I told her you must decide that for
yourself.” He paused, with the intention of letting me say
I didn’t want to go.</p>

<p>“She told me to-night,” I murmured.</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“I think I’d like to go.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span></p>

<p>There was a silence, and I wondered how long we were
going to sit shivering here.</p>

<p>“I had a letter to-night from your Aunt Margaret. She
says you have made friends with some people called Gill,
and have been to a party at their house.”</p>

<p>“Yes: it was last night.”</p>

<p>“Why do you never tell me of any of these things yourself?
One would think I was a total stranger to you!”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know it would interest you.”</p>

<p>All at once I remembered my visits to the opera, and
I couldn’t understand how my father had not heard of
them. He had not mentioned my laxity in regard to
church either, and both these omissions puzzled me greatly,
seeing Aunt Margaret had made such a fuss about them
at the time.</p>

</div>


<p>After breakfast I screwed up my courage to the point of
broaching the subject I had most on my mind. “There
is something I want to say to you,” I began, and my father
instantly adopted an attitude of motionless attention, so
excessively attentive that it had the effect of putting me
out, and I forgot the phrases I had prepared beforehand,
and could only stammer awkwardly that it was my desire
to leave the McAllisters and choose some lodging for myself.</p>

<p>A return to this question I saw was not pleasing to him,
and I had hardly expected it to be so.</p>

<p>“You are very self-willed,” he said, slowly.</p>

<p>I knew from the tone in which this opinion was uttered
that he had already made up his mind about my request,
yet some obscure instinct of self-preservation still kept
me from giving in. I don’t suppose I could have satisfactorily
explained that instinct to my father, even had I
become perfectly confidential, and certainly no such
thought ever crossed my mind. The result was that he
looked upon my wish as a mere caprice.</p>

<p>“It seems to me we have already fully discussed the
question,” he remarked unsympathetically.</p>

<p>“I didn’t know then.... I mean I don’t like sleeping
with George.”</p>

<p>“Why? You have your own bed, haven’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span></p>

<p>“George is your cousin.”</p>

<p>“I know he is my cousin,” I answered wearily. “What
difference does that make?” Already I felt the whole
thing was hopeless.</p>

<p>“It is just this sort of nonsense which makes me object
to your going to stay at Derryaghy,” my father began
impatiently. “You are pampered with every luxury there,
till you begin to dislike and look down upon everybody
who hasn’t had your advantages.”</p>

<p>“I’m not thinking of advantages,” I muttered, with a
sort of irony.</p>

<p>“I didn’t know when I arranged for you to stay with
them that they would not be able to give you a room to
yourself. On the other hand, I don’t see that it is at all
a sufficient reason for your leaving now you are there. I
told you so when I wrote to you. It is only an excuse to
get your own way. You have always been like that;
though I should have thought you would hardly have
considered it worth while to bring the matter up again
after all these months.”</p>

<p>I accepted my father’s decision without further protest.
As a matter of fact, a kind of listlessness had come upon
me, an apathetic indifference to whatever might happen.</p>

<p>It was Christmas Eve. A heavy fall of snow had occurred
during the night, and on the hard, frozen ground it lay
unmelted to the dark border of the sea. All the morning I
spent beside the fire reading “Richard Feverel,” but about
half-past three I went out for a walk over the golf-links.
The snow was several inches deep, but being perfectly hard
was not unpleasant for walking. I had slept badly last
night, a sleep broken by wretched dreams, and I had a
mind to go for a really long walk and tire myself out. In
spite of being at home again, in spite of this beautiful, bright,
exhilarating weather, in spite of the fact that I would be
getting a Christmas-box from Mrs. Carroll to-morrow, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span>
a letter from Katherine, and another from Owen, my spirits
were of the gloomiest. Never before had I looked so
closely into my own soul, and never before had I found so
little there to comfort me. I knew that for months past my
mind had been gradually submitted to a poisonous influence
that had filtered through my blood, like a vapour from some
fever-breeding marsh. Yet certain seeds, I thought, could
perhaps only have taken root within me, could perhaps
only so quickly have sprung to tall dark flower, because
they had found a soil already apt to receive them: and I
remembered my father’s suspicions in the past. I thought
of a book I had been reading lately—a book written for boys,
and all about boys—and I compared myself with its heroes.
I compared the gloom that weighed upon me now with
the troubles they had experienced, and it seemed to me I
must be different, not in degree but in kind, from every
boy in that book, from the bad just as much as from the
good. I remembered hours, whole days, when I had been
like them, like the decent ones I mean, for with the others
I had nothing in common—I had never wanted to shirk
games; and bullying, gambling, dishonesty, and “pubs,”
had no attraction for me. But it was just because there
were bits of the book in which I could see a part of myself
that I was troubled by the absence of other parts, of so
many other feelings that none of these boys shared. I
wondered if I were quite abnormal, but how could I ever
find out even that; for just as nobody knew what I was,
I knew nothing really of anybody else, save what they cared
to show me or took no trouble to hide. I was hopelessly
shut in to the little circle of my own sensations, desires,
and emotions. Owen, whom I knew better than any other
boy,—what, after all, did I know of him? I knew no one
but myself, and of myself I knew much that filled me with
shame.</p>

<p>A deep silence overshadowed all things, the silence of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span>
the fallen snow. I had come to a stand-still. Around
me was an infinite stretch of whiteness, almost unbroken,
save where the sea was dark and restless under the whip
of the rising wind. Dusk had crept up imperceptibly, and
more light now rose from the ground than fell from the
leaden sky overhead. Snow had again begun to fall. A
few flakes turned and fluttered down out of the darkness,
but I knew this was only the beginning. I walked to the
edge of the black, desolate sea, and watched the waves
rolling in to break at my feet, and at that moment I felt
infinitely alone, and indeed for miles round there was
probably no other human being. But it was as if I were
alone in a dead world. The whirling flakes of snow fell
ever faster out of the winter sky; the barren, frozen land
was wrapped in a stillness that was more like the stillness
of death than of sleep; the only sounds there were came
from the waves breaking at my feet, and from an occasional
sweep of wind forlorn as though no ears were there to listen.
The creeping on of night seemed to be the shutting out for
ever of all life, and one could imagine there would never
be anything more, that the end had at last been reached.</p>

<p>And the thought of death came to me, without terror,
came, rather, as a solution. All that bound me to existence
seemed now attenuated to the thinnest cobweb. If I
just lay down here and waited....</p>

<p>Tony, who had grown restless at my long delay, suddenly
broke into my consciousness. He began to urge me to
come on, with a peculiar, eager, discontented note in his
voice. He jumped up with his large paws against me.
I knelt in the snow and hugged him in my arms, while his
warm red tongue passed rapidly over my face. I held him
close, and his black nose was pressed into my cheek, and
he wagged his tail and nibbled at my ears.</p>

<p>Two or three days before, I had sent off a small picture to
Katherine as a Christmas-box. It had taken me a long
time to choose something I thought she might care for,
and which at the same time pleased myself. In the end
I had got her a photograph of Francia’s portrait of the boy
Federigo Gonzaga, the son of Isabella d’Este—the Miserden
Park picture. I had had it framed in a flat, dull, dark
frame, and very carefully packed; and over and over
again I had pictured her opening the parcel, her surprise.
It was two days after Christmas when the postman brought
me a letter from her, but instead of reading it, I put it in
my pocket. It was a fairly thick packet, so, though her
writing was very large, I knew it must be a long letter. I
could feel it as it lay in the inner pocket of my jacket, and
a dozen times that day I drew it out and inspected it, but
no more than that, for I had determined not to read it
till I went to bed. All day long I thought of the pleasure
I should have, and in the end I became so impatient that
I went to bed about nine o’clock.</p>

<p>I put the letter on my pillow, and placed a lighted candle
on the painted, deal chest-of-drawers beside my bed. I
undressed, got into bed, and only then, with eager fingers,
tore open the envelope and drew out its contents.</p>

<p>I looked at them as they lay upon the bright, patch-work
counterpane, a single sheet of note-paper, and a New Year<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
card in the form of a pocket calendar. My disappointment
was so great that for a little I did not even read the letter,
but lay on my back and stared dismally at the iron rail
at the foot of my bed. My thoughts were bitter. I
recalled the many letters I had written to her, undiscouraged
by her brief replies. Some of these had been pages long;
the one I had sent with my present, for instance, I had
given a whole evening to. I glanced at what she had
written—three sides of a sheet of note-paper hastily scrawled
over in huge characters, about two words to a line. She
thanked me for my picture, which was very pretty. She
would have liked to write me a really long letter, but there
were some people staying in the house, and she had to look
after them, and had only been able to snatch a moment
to wish me a happy New Year. That was all.</p>

<p>I blew out the candle and lay with my eyes wide open
staring into the darkness. The few, conventional phrases
of her letter were vivid in my mind. To begin with, the
picture was not pretty; if it had been, I shouldn’t have
bought it. If she had wanted me to have a happy New
Year it would have been very easy for her to make it so.
But it had been too much trouble. I thought of how I
had sat up far into the night to finish my Christmas letter
to her. I heard my father’s step on the stairs, the shutting
of his bedroom door. I pulled the bed-clothes up to my
chin, and as I did so my hand touched something—the
pocket-calendar. I tore it in two and flung the pieces at
the opposite wall.</p>

<p>My mind was divided between despondency and anger. I
pictured her enjoying herself with a houseful of her own and
Gerald’s friends, while I was forgotten. Of course there
was no particular reason why she should remember me.
Still, the irony of those foolish New Year’s wishes might
almost have been intentional had the whole letter not been
so thoughtless. She knew well enough how happy I must<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
be now, stuck in this wretched hole by myself; and I asked
myself how anybody could be so completely devoid of
imagination, of sympathy, even of tact? I began to compose
a letter to be written to-morrow, a letter expressing
what I felt. I imagined her reading it in the midst of her
friends, and realizing how she had wounded me. I tossed
and turned till I was almost in a fever. Sleep was out of
the question, for I knew it must be nearly morning already,
and I had half a mind to get up and dress....</p>

<p>When I opened my eyes it was broad daylight. I sprang
out of bed and hurried into my clothes. The first thing
after breakfast I sat down to write my letter of reproach,
and wrote it at furious speed, a fire burning in my soul.
Yet when I came to read it over, it seemed childish and
stilted, and in my haste I had left out so many words and
mis-spelt so many others that I was obliged to make a fair
copy of the whole. This I posted, but had two days more
of impatience before a reply reached me. When it came, it
had the effect of turning away my anger. Katherine seemed
really sorry; at any rate she said she was. She told me
that she cared far more for me than for any of the people
I imagined she found so delightful, and that I might have
known this by now, even if her letters <em>had</em> been short. She
said it had been horrid of her to write such a miserable
scrawl, but that, if she had guessed I should mind it so
much, she would have written me a whole book.</p>

<p>I sat down to reply at once, but I cannot account for the
unfortunate tone my letter took. It was morbid and self-conscious,
without being in the least frank. I begged her
forgiveness; I made a parade of a melancholy that bore
no resemblance to the kind of melancholy I really felt; I
talked vaguely about not being as good as she believed me
to be, and the whole production was a little sickening. I
don’t know, or rather I do know, what she made of it.
She replied that she had never for a moment thought me<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span>
good, and that she should prefer not to hear from me at all
to getting letters like the last I had written.</p>

<p>It was not, perhaps, extremely sympathetic, but I knew
well enough myself I had done the wrong thing. My
letter had been odiously self-conscious. I had accused
myself of not being good, but what on earth did that mean?
It might mean that I went into the pantry at night and
stole the jam!</p>

</div>


<p>About this time, influenced by Amiel, whom I had come
across in Mrs. Humphry Ward’s translation, I had begun
to keep a diary, or journal, of my “sensations and ideas.”
I unearthed it the other day, with the paper time-staled as
the sensations, and the ink faded as the ideas. On reading it
over I found it so unbalanced, so one-sided, that I can scarce
quote a passage as really expressive of what I actually was.
It expresses only what I was when I sat down to write my
journal, and I never appear to have done this except when
I was in a particularly unhealthy mood. Some of this
journal is descriptive, some of it merely notes certain
thoughts that came to me and that I evidently, the Lord
knows why, imagined worthy of preservation. A single
entry, the description of a dream, will, I fancy, give an idea
of the whole.</p>

<p>“Last night I went out and wandered about the streets
for a while, and when I came home I went straight to bed.
I did not go to sleep for a long time. I remember hearing
the clock strike two, and when I awoke it was just four,
but of course I cannot really tell how long my dream
lasted.</p>

<p>“I was in a room with some people I knew very well. My
father was there, and Aunt Margaret and Uncle George. I
was laughing at something, I cannot remember what, only
that it had to do with a question of religion, when suddenly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span>
the figure of Christ appeared, in a long, purple, velvet robe—a
slight figure, with narrow effeminate face, pointed beard,
and a soft treacherous expression in the slanting eyes.
Everybody in the room except myself fell on their knees
in fear, but I stood still. He watched me and then came
closer, holding out his pierced hands and making the sign of
the cross. He did not speak, but I knew what he meant,
and I detested him. He drew still nearer and still I would
not kneel. My defiance filled me with a mingled fear and
exultation, and, as he was about to touch me, I cried out,
invoking Satan, offering myself to him. A horrible look of
baffled rage and malice distorted the face of the Christ.
Outside a storm was raging and the wide window was a
black square. With a shrill scream the Christ vanished,
and a man, naked, superb, the colour of dark, greenish
bronze, shot through the window as though propelled by
some invisible force. (From this on, an undertone of
strange music floated through my dream, rising and falling
with the rise and fall of my emotions.)</p>

<p>“The face of this dark angel was beautiful and proud.
His forehead was broad and low and slightly overhanging,
giving him a stern and brooding expression, but although I
was afraid of him I loved him, and felt an irresistible longing
to put myself in his power. We were now alone together
in the room, which had suddenly grown dark, and he seized
me. I struggled, but in his grasp I was helpless as a young
bird in the clutches of a boy. He stripped me naked and
rubbed my body over with some kind of ointment that left
no mark. And somehow I knew he was going to send me
down into hell, and that after a while I should return again
to earth, but that I should be his for ever.</p>

<p>“‘I shall not be tortured?’ I asked him, and he answered
in a deep voice, ‘There are no tortures such as you are
thinking of.’</p>

<p>“‘When I come back,’ I said, ‘I shall have forgotten all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
I saw there; I shall think I have been only dreaming. Can
you not mark me in some way?’</p>

<p>“He placed me in front of the mirror that was at one end
of the room, and which seemed to shine in the dark as with
fire. And in the glass I saw over my right breast a red flush,
and upon this a white streak, broad and long as his fore-finger.
He took my hand, and suddenly the room I was in seemed
to be dropping. Down and down it rushed, so rapidly that
the walls glowed red hot, but because of the ointment with
which I had been covered I felt nothing. And we seemed
to be sinking down through a bottomless sea that hissed
in steam against the walls. Then the speed increased a
thousandfold and I lost consciousness.</p>

<p>“I do not know what interval had elapsed, but it was
evening and I was back again in the room, our parlour at
home. My father was kneeling down and calling upon me
in desperation to pray to God before it was too late—to pray—to
pray. But I would not pray. Mrs. Carroll was there
and she was crying. Then a voice said aloud above our
heads, ‘It was all only a dream,’ and for a little we believed
this; and then all at once I knew the voice was lying. My
father read in my face what was passing in my mind, and
his own face grew white as paper. But I knew; and I
exulted and wept at the same moment. I tore away
my shirt from my breast. ‘Look—look! It is his
mark!’</p>

<p>“A loud cry rang through the room, and I awoke, bathed
in perspiration, to the silence and darkness of night. I
could hear George breathing quietly in his sleep. Then I
got up and lit the gas and looked to see if the mark were
indeed there upon my breast, but there was nothing.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Could I have been mentally, morally, even physically,
well when I had this dream? Childish and foolish, perhaps,
it had at the time an intensity the effect of which lingered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
on long after I had awakened. There is something disquieting
in the thought that so slender a veil should separate the
world of order and sanity from a world of disorder and
delirium such as my eyes were opened to then. Yet that
other world is always there, waiting, and the veil may be
torn at any moment, letting tongues of the dreadful, flaming
light shoot through. The Christ of my dream was not a
blasphemous creation of my own mind, but a sort of distorted
memory of one or two pictures in a book about
Byzantine wall-paintings I had looked at years before.
The main fact, however, psychologically, is, I suppose, the
fact that I kept a journal at all. Probably what was at
the bottom of it was an idea of confession which now
haunted me. It came to me in several relations. I thought
of Owen, thought it was my duty to tell him everything
about myself, and that in this way we might make our
friendship perfect. At other times I feared that instead of
doing this it might do just the opposite. I was not sure,
either, what my motive really was—whether it really proceeded
from a sense of duty, or only from a desire of personal
relief. It was strange that while in many respects I continued
to have an exaggerated opinion of myself, I should
yet have been so frequently visited just now by hours of
despondency, when I imagined my life as already irretrievably
doomed to failure. I did not look upon myself as an
ordinary person, or the crisis through which I was passing
as an ordinary crisis. I began to ponder over the meaning
of sin and damnation, and I figured this latter quality as a
condition of mind which attracts evil, and from which no
evil can be hidden. When I was with Owen my troubles
grew fainter, and even disappeared. Mentally, morally,
he had upon me much the same effect as, physically, a
draught of fresh air would have had, after long confinement
in a stifling atmosphere. I admired him; I envied him his
freedom from all that made my own life just now so difficult.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span>
I discussed the question of free will with him, but I no more
believed in it than did my Arabian Nights heroes. I was
as closely imprisoned in my own physical temperament
as a rat in a trap. And if I were to die? For the first
time it dawned upon me that one might pass into a spiritual
world as dark and dreadful as any I had ever seen in a
dream. With this appalling thought it occurred to me that
a priest might be the best person to confess to, and I began
to consider to whom I could go.</p>

<p>The matter, as I soon perceived, was not at all so simple as
in the first flush of discovery it appeared to be. But one
excellent effect it had, and that was to make Sunday, which
had been the dullest, the most interesting, day of the week,
while I went from church to church in search of my confessor.
In almost every case I could tell at once that I had
not found him, and I was on the point of giving up the whole
idea as hopeless, when one Sunday evening I went to St.
Mary Magdalene’s. The clergyman who took the service
was already well past middle-age. He was delicate and
ascetic-looking, with a peculiar expression on his worn face,
as of one who had had to make a fight against something—possibly
it had only been ill-health—and who had come
out of the struggle victorious if not unscarred. He preached
a sermon which may have been slightly vague, but which
appealed to my imagination. Even the weakness of his
voice and the almost colourlessness of his manner had the
curious effect of making what he said to me more real.
Listening to him was like listening to a spirit, to a disembodied
voice; and through all there flickered a kind of
nervous exaltation, like a tremulous, uncertain flame.
There were no signs of that mental and imaginative poverty
which had so frequently discouraged me. But he struck
me, above all, as a man who had been unhappy, and therefore,
if he had found peace, there must be some reason for it.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>
I returned to hear him several times, and although my first
impression was not strengthened, it was not effaced. I
persuaded Owen to come with me to hear him, but Owen
did not like him at all.</p>

<p>Far from shaking me in my view, this unfavourable
opinion helped to confirm me. Not through any perversity,
but simply because I knew the person I was in search of
would not particularly appeal to Owen. I did not want a
purely reasonable being, I did not perhaps even want one
whom Owen would consider quite healthy—I wanted one
who would understand. That night I wrote a letter to
Henry Applin, asking if I might come to him, and, if I
might, would he tell me when.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXV">CHAPTER XXXV</h2>
</div>


<p>As I walked home with Owen next day after school I wanted
to tell him what I had done, but it was somehow difficult to
do so quite abruptly. I turned the conversation to Roman
Catholicism, and from that to the general subject of confession
to a priest, but to Owen this idea appeared to be so
distasteful that I did not attempt to introduce my own
particular case.</p>

<p>On our way we met his mother, who told me to go on in
and get something to eat now, and to stay and dine with
them at seven. I refused, having an idea Owen didn’t
particularly want me. I knew it was only because he wished
to finish an epitome he was making of Herbert Spencer’s
“First Principles” (he had told me he had reached the last
chapter) and as I had a strong desire to stay I felt annoyed.
I came to the door with him.</p>

<p>“You’d better come in,” he said.</p>

<p>“What’s the use of my coming in when you don’t want
me?” I replied.</p>

<p>He laughed. “Of course I want you; don’t be an ass.”</p>

<p>I came in. While we were having tea I looked over the
epitome. It represented a good deal of work, and I remembered
having asked him to read Blake’s “Songs,” and his
refusing because he hadn’t time. It was the same with
nearly everything I recommended to him, though I was
always reading books to please him. He offered now to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span>
lend me the “First Principles” as soon as he should have
finished it.</p>

<p>“I don’t want it,” I answered, discontentedly. “I’m
sick of all that stodgy stuff. You’re always complaining
about not being able to be religious, yet you’re never happy
unless you’re reading something against religion.”</p>

<p>“I’m not anxious for a religion that won’t bear examination,”
replied Owen, coldly.</p>

<p>“No religion <em>will</em> bear it,” I said, and both speeches had
that infinite priggishness which not infrequently characterized
our conversation.</p>

<p>“People who have read a hundred times more philosophy
than I have have been able to remain Christians,” Owen continued,
with a naïveté that was quite lost on me. He was
particularly fond just now of talking about people who had
or had not read philosophy.</p>

<p>“You’re thinking of Levine in ‘A.K.,’” I answered disrespectfully,
a decreasing enthusiasm having led me to abbreviate
the title of this work.</p>

<p>“I’m not,” said Owen.</p>

<p>“You are. And Levine doesn’t remain a Christian.
He drops it and then takes it up again, and, as he hasn’t
any more reason for doing one than the other, I don’t see
what it proves.”</p>

<p>“Why do you say he has no reason?”</p>

<p>“I don’t call half a dozen words spoken by an ignorant
peasant a reason. If you claim religion to be the most
valuable thing in life, it oughtn’t to be at the mercy of a
chance phrase. At any rate the words that affected Levine
seem far from wonderful to me.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know that they aren’t wonderful,” Owen
declared.</p>

<p>“‘One man lives for his stomach,’” I jeeringly quoted,
“‘another for his soul, for God, in truth.’ You’d find the
same thing in any tract. And why should it turn you to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span>
Christianity particularly? A man who believed in Pan
could live just as much for his soul as a Christian.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe anybody ever believed in Pan,” said
Owen, “any more than they believe in Father Christmas.
Because certain words happened to help Levine, Tolstoy
does not mean that they will help everyone.”</p>

<p>“He does. Only you’re nearly as bad as Levine yourself.”</p>

<p>Owen was not listening; he was working out an argument
he would produce as soon as I had done; but I was beginning
to be tired of Tolstoy, and I wanted to express my own
point of view. “If one were to see a ghost, it would make
an enormous difference,” I admitted. “It would open
your eyes to a new world, to a deeper, finer world.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t this one deep enough for you? And I don’t see
that it would necessarily be any finer. It might very well
be extremely objectionable. All that would happen if you
saw a ghost is that it would frighten you very much at the
time, and afterwards you wouldn’t believe in it.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think it would frighten me. I don’t think it
would frighten anybody, if it were the ghost of somebody
they had cared for a great deal.”</p>

<p>Owen considered this. “I don’t suppose the ghost of
your mother would frighten you. <em>Your</em> mother is dead,
isn’t she?” he added, and then stopped short. “I’m
awfully sorry,” he stammered, “I wasn’t thinking of what
I was saying.”</p>

<p>I laughed. “It’s all right. My mother isn’t dead.
Shall we go out before dinner?”</p>

<p>Owen got up.</p>

<p>We walked by the road as far as Shaw’s Bridge, where we
branched off on to the river bank. It was already well on
in April. The brilliant tender green of the opening leaves
had spread like a delicate green flame over the black branches
of the trees. The sky was clear, and there was a sharpness
in the air that made us walk quickly. Owen’s dogs, two<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span>
rough-haired Irish terriers, ran along the bank, sniffing
among the coarse grass, alert, eager to hunt anything,
whether a rat or a stick.</p>

<p>Owen’s remark about my mother had reminded me that
I had told him singularly little about myself, or rather,
about my people. He did not know anything beyond the
fact that we lived at Newcastle, and, from the way I had
spoken of it, he might easily have imagined that Derryaghy
was my home. I’m afraid an unconscious snobbery had
kept me from revealing the obscurity of my origin, and I
was suddenly struck by the stupidity and odiousness of this,
especially with Owen, for whom such things meant nothing.</p>

<p>“Why did you think my mother was dead?” I asked him.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. I suppose because you never—I don’t
know, I’m sure.”</p>

<p>“I want to tell you about my people.”</p>

<p>Curiously enough, though I had been so reluctant to
mention that my father was a National schoolmaster, it did
not trouble me in the least to talk about my mother. I
even had some dim notion that it made me rather interesting;
so I told him all I knew. “I have not seen her
since,” I wound up, “and perhaps my father is not my real
father.” Why I should have thrown in this after-touch I
cannot conceive, as I had never in my life had the faintest
doubts concerning my legitimacy; but I suppose it was to
heighten the romance.</p>

<p>“Do you think I ought to try to find out something
more?” I asked.</p>

<p>“You never did try!” exclaimed Owen.</p>

<p>“Never very much. I don’t know who to ask. I can’t
very well ask my father.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“I can’t.”</p>

<p>“There must be somebody else who knows. Your friend,
Mrs. Carroll.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span></p>

<p>“She won’t tell me.”</p>

<p>“Have you asked her?”</p>

<p>“I asked her the last time I was at home.”</p>

<p>“And what did she say?”</p>

<p>“She doesn’t like her.”</p>

<p>“She said she didn’t like her?”</p>

<p>“No, of course not; but I know it all the same.”</p>

<p>“The whole thing,” Owen began, but tailed off abruptly
“—it seems rather queer.”</p>

<p>We walked on for a long time in silence. I was determined
to tell him about Mr. Applin, but it was not till we
were coming home that I began my explanation.</p>

<p>“And you’re really going to him!” Owen marvelled.</p>

<p>“I’ll have to go now. That is, if he does not tell me not
to.”</p>

<p>“He can hardly do that. You’re not making fun?”</p>

<p>“Fun?”</p>

<p>Owen was silent.</p>

<p>“I didn’t know whether you meant it,” he said.
“What are you going <em>for</em>?” he suddenly asked. “Just
to talk to him?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I suppose so.”</p>

<p>“But what about?”</p>

<p>“About?... Do you remember talking of confession?”</p>

<p>“But it’s not that, is it?” said Owen, very seriously.
“You’re not——”</p>

<p>“Why not?” I smiled dimly.</p>

<p>“But what is the matter? Why should you? What
have you done? And if you have done anything, what is
it to him?”</p>

<p>We had come to a standstill on the lonely river bank.
Owen’s eyes were fixed upon me questioningly. I had
nothing to say, or, rather, I could not say it. I stood
before him, looking on the ground, my hands in my
trouser pockets.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span></p>

<p>Owen hesitated. He put his hands on my shoulders,
but I did not look up.</p>

<p>Presently I raised my head, but I looked away from him,
and across the fields. “Come along,” I said, quietly. “It’s
getting late, and we must hurry.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>When I reached home at about half-past nine little Alice
came running to meet me. Her white face, her bright
black eyes, and long straight black hair, brushed back from
her forehead and spreading out on either side of her face in
the shape of a fan, were vivid in the gas-light, under which
she stood looking up at me while I opened the letter she
had brought me. It was from Mr. Applin, asking me to
call on Wednesday evening between nine and ten, or on
Friday between the same hours, if Wednesday did not
suit me.</p>

</div>


<p>Since Christmas I had been working harder than I had ever
done in my life. The Intermediate examinations would be
coming on in June, but it was not any particular anxiety to
shine in them that had goaded me to this unprecedented
industry; merely I had discovered that on the plea of work
I could sit in my bedroom in the evenings, and that the
work itself kept me from thinking of other things. To-night
I went straight upstairs as usual, but after writing to Mr.
Applin to say I would come on Wednesday, I sat idle. So
it was all the next day, and the next night: I had an open
book in front of me, but I read without comprehending
what I read: I was intensely excited: a kind of emotional
cloud had descended upon my mind, and I could think of
nothing but my approaching interview.</p>

<p>Ideas, words, shot across this mental haze like meteors,
but I could not follow them in their swift flight. On Wednesday
afternoon when I got home from school and had had
my dinner I went out into the streets and wandered aimlessly
about. I had said to myself that I would not think
about the matter any more, but, needless to say, I thought
of nothing else, and so it was that when I came to a Roman
Catholic church and saw the door was open, I could not help
going inside and sitting down before one of the confessionals.
The name of the priest, Father Dempsey, was printed in
large letters above it. I had a faint hope of seeing somebody<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>
come out or go in, but in this I was disappointed. Three
little girls were busy with their beads, but they suspended
their acts of devotion to cast glances at me, and whisper,
and even giggle. A woman was kneeling before an altar
that shone with ornaments suggestive of decorations from a
Christmas tree. Her eyes were fixed on a bright oleograph
of the Virgin, and her lips never ceased moving. A couple
of lighted candles seemed to sweat ugly yellow tears, which
ran down over dirty candlesticks. And then I saw a fat
little sallow priest, his chin, upper lip, and cheeks, blue
from much shaving, come waddling down the aisle, and I
wondered if this were Father Dempsey. As he passed he
stared at me, and I saw in his dull little eyes that expression
of invulnerable stupidity I had noticed in the faces of so
many of his brothers when I met them in the street.</p>

<p>The fascination that had drawn me into the church had
disappeared. Everything—the smell of stale incense, the
cheap decorations, the bad pictures, the kneeling woman,
the girls with their beads—had become almost nauseating.
The appalling unintelligence of it all shocked me, much as
the display of a diseased body had now and then shocked
me. It was wrong, it was gross, anything less spiritual I
could not imagine. And my idea of confessing to a priest
was wrong. I got up and left the church, the last thing I
saw being the thick sediment of dirt at the bottom of the
stoup.</p>

<p>After tea I went up to my bedroom, George’s and mine,
and got out my books to do some work. At first I thought
I would not go to Mr. Applin, but as time passed this
decision grew weaker, and presently, instead of reading, I
tried to make up my mind on the point. Then when it
drew near to nine o’clock I was no longer even uncertain.
What had my impressions of this afternoon to do with the
step I was about to take? Besides, they had been very
superficial, and to be influenced by them would be as stupid<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span>
as to refuse to read a book because its binding happened
to be soiled.</p>

<p>I walked quickly to Mr. Applin’s house and knocked
boldly at the door. It opened with a startling promptitude;
evidently the servant had been in the hall.</p>

<p>“Is Mr. Applin at home?” I asked, my stammer suddenly
beginning to manifest itself.</p>

<p>“He is. Who shall I say wants him?”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t matter. He expects me.” I felt reluctant
to give my name.</p>

<p>The servant did not press me to, but disappeared upstairs.
She came back very soon and asked me to “step this way,”
and I obeyed her nervously.</p>

<p>I entered a room and heard the door close behind me, as a
man rose from a table near the window, removing a green
shade from his forehead. I was conscious of tired eyes
that looked at me out of a pale, dim, emaciated face, but
the flickering light that had seemed to shine through them
when he was preaching was not there, and his manner of
greeting me struck me as a little distant, a little chilly. I
sat down on the extreme edge of a chair and my impressions
grew clearer.</p>

<p>“You are Peter Waring, are you not?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I answered.</p>

<p>He had taken the chair opposite mine, and he leaned a
little forward, the tips of his fingers joined, and blue veins
showing under the loose yellow skin of his hands. He was
much older than I had imagined. He was wearing a threadbare
jacket which I did not like, and I noticed that one of
the buttons near the top was not the same as the others.
My confidence had suddenly drooped. I glanced round at
the unfamiliar room, at the book-shelves which made but
a poor show, and maintained an idiotic silence. It struck
me that he might think I had come for a subscription
towards a cricket club.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span></p>

<p>“I got your letter,” he said. “You want to speak to
me? You are not a member of my congregation, I think?”</p>

<p>“No—I come sometimes in the evening.”</p>

<p>I was glad I had said nothing in my letter but that I
wanted to speak to him, and he evidently hadn’t the least
suspicion of the truth.</p>

<p>“Yes—yes—I understand. Well, don’t be afraid. If I
can do anything for you I shall be very glad, very glad.”</p>

<p>I thanked him and again became silent. It would have
been absolutely impossible for me to have said what I had
come to say. He was too old, too far away. It would
have been like stretching out one’s hands to warm them at
the ashes in an early morning grate. I knew he wanted to
be kind, but I felt, somehow, that if I sat very still he
would, in a minute or two, forget I was in the room.</p>

<p>“I think I had better write,” I murmured.</p>

<p>“Write? But why? What is it about?” he spoke
almost testily.</p>

<p>There was a tap at the door, and a thin, middle-aged lady,
possibly a daughter, came in with a little tray on which were
some biscuits and a tumbler of hot milk. She bowed to me
and wished me good-evening. I wanted nothing now but
to get away as quickly as possible, and I envied her as she
went out, closing the door softly behind her. Suppose I
had been in the middle of my confession when the hot milk
came in, I thought. The whole thing was somehow
becoming lugubriously comic.</p>

<p>“Are you in business or at school?” Mr. Applin asked,
between two sips of milk. “I hope you’ll excuse me taking
this while it is hot, but I had a funeral this afternoon, and
I’m afraid I caught a slight chill.”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” I answered hastily. “I’m sorry for disturbing
you. I have really nothing to say. It is only that
I liked your sermons so much, and that I wanted to tell
you so. I hope you’ll forgive me.” I got up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span></p>

<p>“Sit down—sit down,” he murmured. “It was a very
kind and charming impulse, and I’m glad you yielded to it.”</p>

<p>I resumed my seat and he continued to drink his milk.
He was quite pleased with me. He asked me to what
church I belonged; where I went to school; all kinds of
questions. I told him that I thought he must be lonely
sitting here by himself, and that he should have a dog, or
even a cat. I told him about Tony, and all the wonderful
things he could do. Before I came away he made me
promise I would come to see him again. Yet just as I was
going out a sort of vague suspicion of other things appeared
to float into his consciousness. He detained me, with his
hand on my shoulder. “When you first came in,” he said,
“I thought something perhaps was worrying you, that you
had something on your mind.” He paused. For an
instant I had seen in him what I had seen when I had
listened to him preach; for an instant I was on the point of
resuming my seat, and telling him all I had come to tell him,
but he himself broke the charm next moment by saying
good-night. “And when you come again you won’t be
shy?” he added, smiling wanly.</p>

<p>He did not accompany me downstairs, but stood on the
landing till I had opened the hall-door. And as I pulled it
after me, and ran down the steps, I knew I should never go
back.</p>

</div>


<p>Spring gave place to summer, and still I kept studiously to
my books. I saw less of Owen, for in the afternoons I played
cricket, and Owen did not. On the thirteenth of June my
examination commenced, and from the first I did well,
having good luck with the papers. On Tuesday evening
when I went home I had only one more exam. in front of me,
and it would take place the following afternoon. After that
I should be free for the summer.</p>

<p>It was a hot, breathless kind of night, and I did not intend
to work too much. I loafed about the shop after tea, talking
to Miss Izzy. She had asked me to go to the Free Library
to get her a book, but nothing on the list she had given me,
though it was a fairly long one, was in, and I had come back
with a tale of my own selecting.</p>

<p>“You might have got one of Annie Swan’s,” Miss Izzy
said, eyeing the work I had chosen, dubiously, “but of
course you couldn’t tell what ones I’d read.”</p>

<p>“Annie Swan’s?”</p>

<p>“Yes; they’re all good. Mr. Spicer mentioned ‘Carlowrie’
from the pulpit on Sunday, and you don’t often
hear <em>him</em> praise a novel.”</p>

<p>“When he does it’s a spicy one,” said George, who was
going out.</p>

<p>Miss Izzy took no notice.</p>

<p>“I’ve got to meet the girl at a quarter-to-eight, so I can’t<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span>
stop,” George threw back gaily from the door, which next
moment swung after him, as he stepped into the street,
fixing a flower in his button-hole.</p>

<p>“You get ‘Aldersyde’ and read it,” said Miss Izzy, “or
‘Across Her Path.’”</p>

<p>“I thought you said Carl-something-or-other.”</p>

<p>“You’ll maybe like the others better. If George McAllister
would join the literary society instead of running about
the streets at nights it would answer him better. Who’s
this girl he’s going to meet?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“It’s only talk, I suppose. Girls have more sense than to
bother with the likes of him.”</p>

<p>“Do you think so?” I murmured sceptically. “The
kind that George cares for I don’t imagine have very
much.”</p>

<p>“You know nothing about them. If you’d any sisters
you’d know more.”</p>

<p>“I’m very glad I haven’t,” I replied.</p>

<p>Miss Izzy bounced round. “Why?” she demanded
sharply. “Girls can do everything as well as men can;
only they never get the chance.”</p>

<p>“That’s all rot,” I said ungallantly. “They’re quite
different. You might as well compare cats and dogs.”</p>

<p>“And we’re the cats, I suppose? It’s well you’re still a
puppy.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t mean you, Miss Izzy. I know there are exceptions.
But most girls don’t think; or if they do, it’s
only about who’s going to marry them.”</p>

<p>“Don’t think! Well, of all!—And you and George
McAllister and the others—you think a lot, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“George doesn’t,” I admitted.</p>

<p>“But <em>you</em> do—especially about yourself. Do you know
this, Peter Waring, you’re about as conceited and full of
yourself as a monkey that’s been taught a few tricks!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span></p>

<p>“Well, I’m going away to-morrow, and you’ll not see me
again for a long time.”</p>

<p>This was not fair, as I knew it would soften Miss Izzy,
and it had indeed this result. “I don’t mind seeing you,”
she confessed, with a sigh, “if that’s all. It’s hearing you
talk. You may give me your photograph if you like.”</p>

<p>I had had my photograph taken quite recently for Mrs.
Carroll’s birthday, and I ran upstairs and brought one
down. Miss Izzy examined it critically. “I’ve got a red
plush frame at home that’s about your mark.”</p>

<p>“Don’t put me in red plush,” I begged.</p>

<p>Miss Izzy looked up from the photograph to the original.
“Is red plush not good enough for you? You’d like a
gold frame, maybe?”</p>

<p>“It’s not that,” I said hastily. “It’s only that I don’t
care much for red plush. Can’t you get a plain frame?
I will get one for you.”</p>

<p>“No, thanks. I always put a plain person in an ornamental
frame: it gives them a better chance.”</p>

<p>“All right.”</p>

<p>There was never any use trying to get an advantage over
Miss Izzy in verbal skirmishes, so I gave in, and, as the shop
appeared to be comparatively deserted to-night, I sat down
on an empty wooden box, and read aloud to her the first
two chapters of the novel I had brought from the library.
It was Hardy’s “Two on a Tower,” and as I turned the
pages, the circumstances, so different, under which I had
read them before, kept floating into my mind. When I had
finished the second chapter, and drummed for a while with
my heels against the box, I went upstairs, and got out my
notes on French composition to look them over before to-morrow’s
examination. The room, although the window
was wide open, seemed to me unbearably stuffy, and
moreover I had a slight headache and felt tired and irritable.
I put up with the heat for half an hour, and then undressed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span>
and sat down in my nightshirt close to the window, which
looked out on to a dirty strip of back garden, threaded with
clothes-lines, and forming, after dark, a kind of debased
Paradise for dissipated cats.</p>

<p>At half-past ten or so George stepped jauntily in.
“Hello! Not done yet?” He took the now withered
flower from his button-hole and flung it out among the
cats; then he began to turn over some papers I had laid
down on the table in the exact order I required them.</p>

<p>“You’ll mix those up,” I said crossly. “Leave them
alone.”</p>

<p>George threw the papers down. “All right. Keep
your wool on!” Two or three of the sheets fluttered to
the floor.</p>

<p>I picked them up in a very bad temper, and George began
to whistle—the same few bars over and over again. “Oh,
shut up,” I cried. “Can’t you see I’m working?”</p>

<p>“Temper! Temper!” said George, cheerfully. “I’ll
have to tell Katherine about this!”</p>

<p>He was standing before the looking-glass, and had begun
to remove his dickey; but at the very moment of speaking
he knew he had made a mistake. He looked round with a
sort of foolish, apologetic grin. I, too, knew that his words
had slipped out unintentionally, for I had never mentioned
Katherine’s name to him. There were, in fact, only two
ways in which he could have come by his information:
either Aunt Margaret had managed to get hold of some of
my letters again, or else he had read one of them himself.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” I asked coldly, looking steadily
into his eyes as they were reflected in the glass.</p>

<p>George tried to laugh it off. “I was only joking,” he
said, nervously.</p>

<p>But I wanted a better explanation than this.</p>

<p>“Who told you about Katherine?” I asked, getting up
from my chair deliberately, and walking over to him, while<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span>
he spun round to meet me with bright eyes and a forced
smile.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter? What are you losin’ your rag
about? I don’t want to annoy you.”</p>

<p>“The matter is this: I want to know if you have been
reading my letters? If you have, you must have unlocked
the box I keep them in.”</p>

<p>“I never unlocked any box.” George backed away from
me, his eyes not leaving mine.</p>

<p>“You’d better tell me,” I said, but George would say
nothing further. He stood with his back now against the
wall. I struck him on the cheek with my open hand.
“Answer,” I said.</p>

<p>I saw his eyes turn to the door, and anticipated the spring
he made to get past me. The next moment I had him by
the throat and we were struggling together. Suddenly I
released my hold, flinging him from me. He struck out at
me as I came toward him again, but it was the feeble, half-hearted
blow of a coward, and I felt my fist in contact with
his face, almost as if he had run up against it. He staggered
back, and a crimson stream poured down over his chin and
on to his shirt, making a horrible mess, while he stood
blubbering like a baby. I did not hit him again, but simply
watched him. I knew he was really more frightened than
hurt, for though his nose was bleeding profusely, I had seen
it do that on several occasions before, quite spontaneously.
We must, all the same, have kicked up a considerable
racket, for I heard the sound of quick footsteps in the
passage, and then our door was flung open and a wild figure
rushed in. It was Aunt Margaret, in a stained, red dressing-gown,
her black eyes blazing in her big, puffy face. Her
huge loose body shook and panted with rage as she turned
from George to me. I stepped quickly out of her way, for
there was something rather fearful in the great white mask
of hate she turned on me. She said not a word, but shooting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span>
out an arm, like a shoulder of mutton, gripped me by the
collar of my nightshirt, and began to rain down a torrent of
heavy blows on my head and uplifted arms. I protected
myself as well as I could, and at last, with a violent wrench,
tore myself out of her grasp, my nightshirt ripping down to
the hem, a considerable portion of it remaining in Aunt
Margaret’s hand. “Stop that!” I shouted furiously, but
she came at me again, her fat body panting yet displaying
an incredible activity, her eyes shining with madness.</p>

<p>I knew there would be mischief done, for I saw her catch
up an iron rod that was part of George’s trouser-stretcher.
I was really frightened now, and made a dive to get past her
and out of the door. I felt her nails tear my naked shoulder;
at the same moment I flung up my arm and, it may be,
saved my life, for something crashed down over my elbow,
striking on the back of my head with a sickening jar that
I seemed to hear as the floor swept up to meet me.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXVIII">CHAPTER XXXVIII</h2>
</div>


<p>When I opened my eyes I was lying in bed, with a hot jar
at my feet, and the pungent irritation of smelling-salts in
my nostrils. Uncle George was in the room, and there was
a stranger there also. I knew what had taken place, and,
if I hadn’t remembered, there was an atrocious pain in my
head to remind me. I put up my hand and discovered my
head was bandaged.</p>

<p>“Well,” said the stranger, drawing closer. “How do
you feel now?”</p>

<p>“My head’s pretty sore,” I answered.</p>

<p>He mixed me something in a glass and I drank it. Uncle
George came over and began to ask questions, but the
doctor pulled him away. “Leave him to go to sleep now:
he’ll be better able to talk in the morning. It might have
been a nasty thing. I’ll look in to-morrow.”</p>

<p>I had closed my eyes, and when I opened them again I
was alone and in the dark. A ray of moonlight floated
through the window and lay across the floor where George’s
bed had been, but the bed itself was gone, and I wondered
languidly how they had been able to take it away without
my hearing anything. In spite of an abominable headache
I felt drowsy—perhaps it was the effect of whatever drug I
had taken—and I must very soon have lost consciousness.</p>

<p>The first person I saw in the morning was Uncle George,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span>
who carried me in my breakfast. My head still ached,
though not nearly so violently. While I drank a cup of tea
Uncle George sat in silence, his eyes fixed on me, with an
expression of anxiety that was almost comic. As for me,
I felt better, and, when Uncle George had removed the tray,
I allowed him to tell me how sorry he was, but without
replying or giving him any encouragement. I could see he
was dying for me to say something, but I thought a little
suspense would not do him any harm, so I maintained a
discreet quiet. Secretly I was glad, for this disagreeable
adventure gave me just what I had needed, but I was far
from letting Uncle George know that.</p>

<p>“She wasn’t responsible,” said Uncle George, dejectedly,
and plunging straight to the heart of the subject. “You
know she has to take drugs sometimes on account of the
pain she suffers, and they have an effect upon her. I tell
you this in confidence, and that last night she had taken
more than she intended to, and didn’t really know what she
was doin’. But you must forgive her, Peter. And then
she is jealous of you—I may as well tell you everything—she
is jealous when she thinks of the difference between you
and George, and that you will be a gentleman, while George
and the others’ll have to get along as best they can—and
times are so bad, and there’s so few openings for lads nowadays.
This drug she had taken——” He stopped and his
eyes fastened on mine appealingly.</p>

<p>“What do you want me to do?” I asked, smoothing
down the sheet.</p>

<p>Uncle George moved nervously in his chair, but did not
reply.</p>

<p>“I’m going home to-day,” I went on.</p>

<p>“Home? You’ll be waiting for a day or two—till you
get quit of this pain in your head, won’t you? And then
there’s your examination! Will they take marks off if you
get a doctor’s certificate?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span></p>

<p>“A certificate for what?”</p>

<p>“That you can’t go in for the examination.”</p>

<p>“I’m going in for the exam. And I’m certainly going
home.”</p>

<p>Uncle George, who had never ventured to remonstrate
with me on any subject whatever since my arrival, and who
treated me as, if anything, slightly older than himself, did
not begin now. “And what will you tell them?” was all
he asked.</p>

<p>“Would you like me to say I fell downstairs?” I suggested
innocently.</p>

<p>Uncle George fidgeted. “I don’t want you to tell a lie,”
he made answer, which was a pretty big one for him.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t mind,” I observed, pleasantly.</p>

<p>Uncle George considered this. “I suppose there’s times,
maybe, when it’s best not to tell all the truth,” he brought
out lamely.</p>

<p>“This is one when I should think it would be best not to
tell any of it,” I replied.</p>

<p>Uncle George was silent. I was not letting him off particularly
easily.</p>

<p>“There must, however, be two lies told,” I pursued.
“The first by me, and the second by you, in a letter saying
you can’t take me back after the holidays—that you haven’t
room—any reason you like.”</p>

<p>“But won’t you come back?” asked Uncle George,
dolefully. “You were always quite comfortable, quite
happy till—till this accident. And it wouldn’t have happened
if you hadn’t been knocking George about. I don’t
know what he had done on you.”</p>

<p>“I was never happy,” I said impatiently. “Either you
or Aunt Margaret will have to write as I say, or I’ll tell my
father exactly what happened. This accident, as you call
it, very nearly did for me: and it’s only one thing out of a
lot.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span></p>

<p>“Your poor aunt wants to come and tell you how sorry
she is.”</p>

<p>“My poor aunt needn’t bother. I know exactly how
sorry she is. If it had been the ceiling that had fallen on
me and killed me outright, I don’t fancy she’d have minded
much—except for the mess.”</p>

<p>Uncle George regarded me mournfully. “You’re very
unforgiving,” he said. “I know you’ve a right to say hard
things, but——”</p>

<p>It seemed to me that this was going a bit too far. “What
do you mean by unforgiving?” I asked. “Haven’t I
promised not to tell?”</p>

<p>“It’s not that,” said Uncle George.</p>

<p>“What is it then? Do you want me to sacrifice myself
simply that you may make so much a week out of me?
Don’t you know that Aunt Margaret has always hated me
like poison? Don’t you know she is pretty constantly
under the influence of whatever it is she takes, though you
speak as if this were the first time? I’m not such a fool
that I can’t see what’s going on. She’s always prying about
my things and reading my letters. Besides, in the very
beginning, you know as well as I do that I came to live here
expecting to have a room to myself and not to be stuck with
George.”</p>

<p>Uncle George did not reply, but he looked as he sat there,
with his gray head bent, the picture of dejection.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry if I’ve hurt your feelings, Uncle George, for
you’ve been always very kind and decent to me, and if there
was no one here but you and Alice I would come back
certainly. But as it is, I can’t; I really can’t. I wanted
to leave at Christmas, only my father wouldn’t let
me.”</p>

<p>As I watched him lift his mild, sheep-like face, and go out,
I pitied him—almost enough to have promised to do what
he wanted, which would have been idiotic. “If he’d had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span>
any sense,” I told myself, “he’d have clapped Aunt Margaret
into a ‘home’ or an asylum, or whatever it is, long
ago. But he’s too soft-hearted to do anything but make
himself miserable.”</p>

<p>During the morning little Alice came in several times to
see me. The doctor also called and examined my head, into
which he had put a couple of stitches last night. It was
only a scalp wound, he said, and thought I might go back
to Newcastle that afternoon if I felt up to it.</p>

<p>At dinner-time George appeared, looking very sheepish,
and shuffling his feet. “How are you?” he asked. “Ma
says you’re goin’ home this afternoon, so I thought I’d drop
in an’ say good-bye. I’m sorry about this. It’s my fault,
an’ it’s rotten for your exam. I only read one letter. I
went to ma’s work-basket for the scissors, an’ I saw it there
lying open, an’ I read it without thinking. That’s the God’s
truth, whether you believe it or not, an’ there was nothin’
in it you need mind.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s all right,” I answered.</p>

<p>“All the same it’s damned putrid luck about the exam.”</p>

<p>“It can’t be helped. Besides, I’m going to have a shot at
it.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll have to cut on. So long, Peter.” He grinned
as he held out a big hand, which, like his face, was covered
with freckles.</p>

<p>My examination was at three, and at two o’clock I got up.
If I hadn’t done so well on the other papers, probably I
should have let it go, but it seemed, in the circumstances,
a pity to spoil my results if I could possibly avoid it. Yet
when I lifted my head from the pillow it throbbed so violently
that I thought I should have to lie down again. I steadied
myself, holding on to the bed-post, but presently I was able
to finish dressing and go downstairs. Miss Izzy was in the
shop, alone, and she gazed at me with keen curiosity. I
smiled, though I was really feeling fairly bad.</p>

<p>“Are you better?” Miss Izzy asked, for some reason
speaking in a kind of hoarse whisper.</p>

<p>“I’ve a beastly headache, that’s all.”</p>

<p>“Not much wonder. <em>She</em> did it, didn’t she?” Miss
Izzy was all eyes and secrecy.</p>

<p>I nodded.</p>

<p>“She’s getting worse,” Miss Izzy announced in an awed
tone. “She’s really not in her right senses. I don’t know
what she’ll be doing next. You’re going to-day, aren’t
you?”</p>

<p>“Yes—after the exam. I wish you would ask Alice to
pack my things for me; she can do it all right.”</p>

<p>“I’ll help her. I’ll tell you this, I’ve been looking out
for another job this while back, and I think I’ve got one.
That’s between ourselves; but I can’t put up with her any<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span>
longer. I’ll drop you a postcard; give me your
address.”</p>

<p>I scribbled it on a bit of paper she handed me.</p>

<p>Miss Izzy glanced at it and stuffed it in her pocket.
“Right oh! Here’s somebody coming in; they never give
you a minute’s peace—— Are you away?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I think I’ll take a cab.”</p>

<p>The customer had entered, but Miss Izzy only glared at
her. “I’m sure you shouldn’t be going at all. It may just
give you brain fever or something!”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t think so,” I smiled.</p>

<p>Miss Izzy nodded at me as she advanced reluctantly to her
duty. “I’ll see you later.”</p>

<p>“Yes. You’ll not forget to tell Alice?”</p>

<p>“No; that’ll be all right.”</p>

<p>At the stand by the gas-works I got into a hansom and
drove off. I kept my cap on the seat beside me, for any
pressure on my head was painful. Fortunately I had only
a short distance to go, and once in the cool airy hall I felt
better. But my bandaged appearance created quite a
sensation. Everybody stared at me, and one of the superintendents
came to ask me if I had met with an accident.
I told him I had fallen downstairs, at which he indulged in
a somewhat obvious jest.</p>

<p>The paper suited me and did not require any great
effort, but when I had finished I was glad. Outside, I
had to repeat my fiction of falling downstairs, and listen
to various versions of the superintendent’s joke, before I
was able to get Owen by himself. We went into the Botanic
Gardens and sat down on the first vacant bench, where
I told him what had actually happened. He did not appear
to realize that I might have been killed, and, in spite of his
sympathy and the questions he asked, I knew his thoughts
were really hovering round the examination, and that he was
weighing the chances of his having retained his last year’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span>
exhibition. We talked of my adventure, but, as we did so,
unconsciously, he drew the examination paper from his
pocket and unfolded it. Owen had not been doing so well
as I had, and a good deal depended on the marks he got
this afternoon. “I wouldn’t mind,” he said, “only there’s
something I’m doing which the pater will make me give up
if I don’t keep my ‘ex.’”</p>

<p>“If I’d been killed,” I said, “I wonder if you’d have gone
over the questions with Grimshaw or O’Brian!”</p>

<p>Owen glanced at me to see if I were serious. He had by
this time spread out the blue sheet on his knees. “What
did you put for ‘cane-bottomed chair?’” he asked,
anxiously.</p>

<p>But my interest in the exam. had vanished. “Oh, I
don’t know—‘chaise cannée,’ or something. Look here,
Owen, will you come and see me off at the station? I
have to go back to the house, of course, to get my things,
but I’d rather have somebody with me.”</p>

<p>“‘Chaise cannée?’ How did you think of it? I
wonder if it’s right? I put ‘au fond de jonc,’ but I’m
sure that’s rot. ‘Chaise cannée.’ You know, it’s not fair
giving things like that! What do you think?”</p>

<p>“Of ‘au fond de jonc’? I don’t think much of it.”</p>

<p>Owen was depressed. “It doesn’t sound right, does it?
What did you put for ‘fire-dogs?’ O’Brian put ‘chiens
de feu.’”</p>

<p>“O’Brian’s a fool,” I answered, truthfully.</p>

<p>Owen laughed, but without merriment, and I was pretty
sure he had put ‘chiens de feu’ himself. “You might
drop that beastly paper,” I said, “and tell me if you’ll come
or not.”</p>

<p>“Of course I’ll come. But tell me just this one thing.”</p>

<p>“What? ‘Fire-dogs?’—‘chenets.’”</p>

<p>“‘Chenets?’ Are you sure? You’re awfully clever
at those out-of-the-way words!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span></p>

<p>“It’s not an out-of-the-way word. ‘Chiens de feu’ are
the sort of things that’ll be chasing you and O’Brian in the
next world.”</p>

<p>Owen laughed ruefully, but another question, in spite of
his promise, was already hovering on his lips.</p>

<p>“Come along,” I said, getting up. “What good does
it do worrying over the rotten thing now?” And I tore
my paper in two, and let the pieces go fluttering down the
path on the wind.</p>

<p>In the morning Tony’s familiar scratching at my door
reminded me that I was home again, and this time for two
long, idle months. I was very sleepy, but I struggled out
of bed with half-open eyes, and let him in. As I closed
the door again, I trod on one of his paws. He gave a sharp
yelp, and then a great wagging of his tail to show that he
knew it had been an accident. Jumping on to the bed he
scrambled between the sheets, and I followed, taking what
room he would give me. I lay trying to go to sleep,
while he sprawled over me. Then when he had thoroughly
wakened me up he went to sleep himself.</p>

<p>I lay listening to the sea and thinking of what I should
do that day. I would bathe after breakfast; I would take
Tony with me, which would mean bathing off the sand, for
Tony could not dive, and had a foolish habit, when on the
rocks, of trying to lap the sea up to the level he wanted it
at. But I had forgotten my plastered head; bathing, I
supposed, would be out of the question for at least a week.
So, when breakfast was over, I stuffed a book into my
jacket pocket, and strolled in the direction of Derryaghy
woods. I had the long June day before me, and perfect
freedom to do just as I pleased with it. The book I had
chosen was “Twelfth Night,” the influence of Count Tolstoy,
so far as I was concerned, having suffered an eclipse. I
had read no second work by him, and the questionings<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span>
stirred up by “Anna Karénine” had sunk quietly to
sleep. Owen, a day or two ago, had got hold of “Katia,”
and “The Kreutzer Sonata,” but I, I regret to say, had not
a line of the master’s in my possession.</p>

<p>In truth, I was but a degenerate disciple, and moreover
unfaithful. For Owen and I had sent the great man a
letter for the New Year, protesting allegiance, and had
actually received a reply, which, considering it had almost
moved Owen to tears, I had allowed him to keep. He regarded
it with the kind of veneration that, in earlier days,
a devout pilgrim may have regarded some relic of a saint.
I shouldn’t have been surprised to learn that he wore it,
tied up in a little bag, somewhere beneath his clothes.
Really it had been quite decent; though that a man of
world-wide fame, who must have been besieged by communications
of all kinds and from all sorts of persons, should
have found time to understand and reply kindly to the
epistle of a couple of youngsters, far away in a benighted
island, I’m afraid did not strike me then as quite the
wonderful thing it was. The letter, however, was not to
me, and Owen, at all events, had found it wonderful
enough. In spite of my share in the matter, the spirit
of our enterprise had been Owen’s. The epistle we had
concocted had expressed Owen, and Owen alone, and it
was delightfully intelligent of the master to have seen
behind its crudity something worth encouraging. He had
actually asked us—that is Owen—to write again—not at
once and under the immediate influence of his letter, but
in a month or two. And Owen had written again. By
that time I had had the sense to recognize that I was only
a shadow in this matter, and to give him a free field. He
had waited the full two months, which I, had I felt his
enthusiasm, could never have done, and had then written
the second letter. This letter I had insisted must be private.
I had refused to take any part in its composition, or even<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span>
to read it when it was finished, though Owen had told me
all that was in it—a complete account of himself, of his
father’s position, of his own acquirements and abilities,
his prospects, his ideals, ending up with a petition for advice
as to the direction his studies ought to take, and as to what
career lay open to him. The reply to this effusion had
not yet come or I should have heard of it, but I hadn’t
the slightest doubt that when it did turn up Owen would
follow its instructions minutely, down to the smallest particulars,
even were that to entail the wearing of peas in his
shoes. It was the sort of thing that was completely beyond
me. I could not have borne to admit, even to myself, that
anybody was so much my superior as all that. And then,
very softly, at the bottom of my soul, I preferred “A
Midsummer Night’s Dream” to “Anna Karénine.” I
not only preferred it, but I was sure it was a work of far
finer genius. Of course I was always sure that the things
I happened to prefer were far finer, but in this particular
instance I have not altered my opinion.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>As I wandered up into the woods, followed by the lagging
Tony, I knew it was going to be a very hot day, though
it was not nearly so hot at present as Tony pretended.
I hunted about till I had found a pleasant place—where the
rising ground formed a kind of natural couch, covered
with golden moss and bracken, and where the sun at noon
would not be too strong as it dropped down through thick
green beech branches. I took my book from my pocket,
but it was only to make myself more comfortable, not with
any intention of reading. I lay there and let the green
summer morning steal into my soul, staining my mind
to its own deep cool colour, while Tony gnawed at the trunk
of a fallen tree, stripping off the bark in sheets, till he was
tired and hot, when he came over beside me and stretched
himself on the bracken, with his red tongue hanging out<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span>
and his eyes nearly closed. And I lay on in the enchanted
morning, my hands under my head, gazing up through the
flat, shady branches, and thinking “long, long thoughts.”
Already I seemed to have cast from me, as a snake his old
skin, the weight and grime of a year of town life; already
I felt better, cleaner, felt the sap of my youth fresh and
strong within me.</p>

<p>After an hour or two I opened my book and began to
read:—</p>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“If music be the food of love, play on;</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Give me excess of it, that, surfeiting,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">The appetite may sicken, and so die.</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">That strain again! it had a dying fall;</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">O! it came o’er my ear like the sweet sound</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">That breathes upon a bank of violets,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Stealing and giving odour....”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>I was lost in that world of poetry and music, of lingering
melodies and songs, dreamy and happy and sad. Romance!
romance! I felt it stirring in my blood, singing within me!
This play of passion, where passion is never stormy, but a
kind of dreaming of love, exactly suited my present mood.
Love was the world I lived in, love was in the rustling
of the beech-leaves, love was in the breaking of the invisible
sea, love was even in the snores of Tony.</p>

<p>I closed the book, my mind filled with laughter and love
and poetry. Beautiful figures glided before me through
the sun-washed, leaf-green air—Viola in her boy’s clothes—Olivia—moving
in an atmosphere of sensuous sweetness.
I imagined myself a page, visiting Olivia in her palace; I
imagined her falling in love with me; I began to weave
a romance of my own, in which scenes from other romances
lingered, the music of their words....</p>

<p>The sunlight splashed through the beech-leaves on to
the green moss, and where it fell the green took a hue of
gold. Green arcades opened out into the heart of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span>
summer woods. Rarely came the note of a bird, but the
woods were full of life; the flashing whites and grays of
rabbits appeared on the clearing nearer the house; there
were mysterious movements in the brushwood. I roused
reluctant Tony and we went down to the stream. We
were out in the broad sunshine here, and the rocks were
quite hot. The dark green silky waterweed spread out,
seeming to flow with the rapid, shallow water, and sleepy
summer noon held me spell-bound. In the shadow of the
rocks were deep pools, where the water looked almost black.
Tony waded out into mid-stream and began to lap up the
water. Then he lifted his head, his red, dripping tongue
still hanging out, his dark, beautiful eyes half-closed, and
looked at me while he panted. The woods on either side
were full of green shadow and mystery. We walked home
over soft turf and across a blazing field dotted with fly-tormented
cows. Tony was too hot even to give them a
passing bark. On the right the ground sloped down gently,
forming a vast meadow, with scattered trees and flaming
gorse-bushes; and beyond, under the deep blue sky, the
great glorious sea danced and gleamed, blue also, with a
long white line where the surf curled up over the flat, sun-drenched
sand.</p>

<p>I felt lazy and contented, conscious only of the warmth
of the sun and the beauty of this world, wrapped in a kind
of sleepy happiness. In the afternoon I would go in search
of some of my old friends; go out, perhaps, with Willie
Breen in his boat, though as a rule boating in any form
bored me to death. Trivial and bizarre thoughts passed
through my mind. I wished the world was the way it is
in old romances and fairy-tales. I was sure that this was
the very day on which some wonderful thing would happen;
when one might find a magic door leading into a strange
world that was yet quite close at hand; for all my life
long I had had the feeling that such a world was there.</p>

</div>


<p>During the next three weeks I led a solitary enough life,
in the woods and by the sea. I read a good deal, and
dreamed still more. In the mornings, and often in the
afternoons as well, I went for long swims, and, coming back,
lay in the sun on the rocks, sometimes for hours at a time,
so that the skin all over my body had been tanned to a deep
golden brown. And I was growing stronger. I could feel
it; I could even see it in my limbs, which were becoming
more muscular. And with my increasing physical strength
I suppose other alterations took place—alterations in my
outward appearance, marking the passage from boyhood to
adolescence. Annie Breen, for instance, had spoken to me
several times of late in a way that betokened a consciousness
of this change; and more than one girl whom I met on
the road in the evenings, when wishing me good-night, had
put something into her greetings which made it quite different
from what it would have been last year. Several of the
village boys, no older than I, had already sweethearts, and
I knew I had but to give a sign to any of these girls to
have a sweetheart also; and while I held myself aloof, and
responded with the barest politeness, I none the less felt
flattered.</p>

<p>I received news of my examination. I had done better
than I had expected, getting first place in the school
and third in Ireland. Owen, too, had not done badly; at
all events he had retained his exhibition.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XLII">CHAPTER XLII</h2>
</div>


<p>I met Owen at the station, and, as he jumped out of the
carriage, he cried, “I’ve got the letter. It was waiting for
me when I reached home.” He waved it triumphantly in
my face, beaming with the delight of it and with the pleasure
of showing it to me.</p>

<p>“I can’t possibly read it here,” I said, grasping his bag.</p>

<p>“And I say, you know, you did rippingly in the exams.
I knew you would.”</p>

<p>He had come down by the first train, and I wanted to
take him for a bathe, but he was so excited that he could
hardly listen to me. I had brought our towels, and I
delivered Owen’s bag to a carman outside to take up to the
house.</p>

<p>“Where are we going now? It was jolly decent of him
writing, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Who? Tolstoy? Not bad. But we’re going to
bathe: I waited for you. It’s some distance away, unless
you would rather wade in off the shore; there’s plenty of
time, however.”</p>

<p>“I’ll do whatever you like.”</p>

<p>“Then I think we’ll go round to Maggie’s Leap.”</p>

<p>As we went we talked of his precious letter. “You won’t
like it, I daresay,” he said. “It’s not much in your line.”</p>

<p>“I wish you would tell me what my line is. I’ve been
trying to discover during the last fortnight.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span></p>

<p>“I know very well.... There’s one thing he says that
I can’t quite——”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s this: He says everything is in the Gospels.
What people have got to do is to read over the words of
Christ, and mark with a red pencil everything that is
perfectly clear to them.”</p>

<p>“A red pencil?”</p>

<p>Owen was too eager to notice anything. “Yes. What are
you amused at? Then you cut those bits out, and never
bother about the rest. In what you cut out you’ll find
everything that it is necessary to know in order to map
out your life and your work. The whole teaching of Christ,
all that is essential, will be in those bits. Later on you may
read over the other things, that were obscure, and perhaps
some of them will by then be plain. I am to consider what
kind of work I have a taste for, and at the same time the
work I devote myself to must fulfil certain tests or I am to
have nothing to do with it. Work you do with your hands
is best of all. I haven’t shown the letter at home yet. I
thought I’d think it quietly over down here and talk about
it with you. We’ll read the Gospels together. My father
wants me to be a solicitor and go into his place, but I don’t
want that. On the other hand, I must make up my mind
soon, I suppose. I’m seventeen, you know.”</p>

<p>I took the letter from him, and read it slowly and with
some difficulty as we walked along. After that, I thought
over it for a while.</p>

<p>“Will you have to earn your living?”</p>

<p>“Yes, naturally. There are a good many of us, you
know.”</p>

<p>“Then I don’t see how the Gospels are going to help you,
no matter what way you mark them.”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“Because you’ll have to live as other people do, unless<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span>
you can afford to be different; and other people don’t live
according to the Gospels.”</p>

<p>Owen was silent.</p>

<p>“A carpenter, a gardener, for instance,” he began,
“couldn’t they live in accordance with the teaching of
Christ? Tolstoy says I will never be happy unless I do.”</p>

<p>“It’s all very well for Tolstoy talking: he is his own
master and has plenty of money. But how can you be a
carpenter or a gardener? Your father would never allow
you to, and the first thing would be a quarrel with him. We
go down here, over this wall.”</p>

<p>Owen scrambled after me.</p>

<p>“A man must leave his father and his mother.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Owen dear, but you’re not a bit the kind of man
who does, to say nothing of leaving your brother and your
sisters. At any rate, while you are learning to be a gardener
your father will have to keep you.”</p>

<p>“I only mentioned those trades because they happened
to occur to me; there are plenty of others.”</p>

<p>“There are not plenty: that’s just the difficulty I’ve
been finding.”</p>

<p>We clambered down on to the rocks, from which the sea
stretched away, deep and clear and blue, glittering in the
hot sunshine, moving with a low, smooth swell, like some
huge, splendid, living creature.</p>

<p>“You will require a profession in which you can be your
own master from the very beginning. It wouldn’t do to be
subordinate to anybody who hadn’t had a letter from Tolstoy,
or perhaps even read ‘Anna Karénine.’ If you go in for
the Church, for example, you will have to do what you are
told until you get a church of your own, when you’ll be
always having rows with your parishioners and elders, for, of
course, you’ll have to preach the Tolstoy gospel or the
tests will get in the way. If you become a doctor you won’t
make a living, because you will want to doctor the widows<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span>
and the fatherless, who are no use in the matter of fees. I
admit the lawyer idea is absurd—even without Tolstoy and
the Gospels it wouldn’t have done—and no doubt your
father only thought of it because he’s a solicitor himself.
You’ll have to be content with something that fulfils perhaps
one or two of the tests. Then, when you get married and
have a swarm of children, your wife will rise in revolt against
them <em>all</em>.”</p>

<p>“I can choose a suitable wife, and there’s no need to have
a swarm of children. I shall have just as many as I can
afford to bring up properly.... That reminds me, I
brought you down the ‘Kreutzer Sonata.’ It’s in my bag.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right; but it’s always people like you, frightfully
earnest and moral and all the rest of it, who have
families of twelve or thirteen.”</p>

<p>“I tell you I won’t have them,” said Owen, impatiently.</p>

<p>“But Tolstoy himself——”</p>

<p>“I don’t care a hang about Tolstoy.”</p>

<p>“Oh—h! Owen!”</p>

<p>“Tolstoy could give his children a decent start in life;
and if he can do that, the more such a man has the better.”</p>

<p>During the latter part of this conversation, all of which
Owen was taking in dead seriousness, we were undressing,
and I now dived into the deep, green, glittering water. I
turned on my back and lay watching Owen, distinctly
uneasy, stand hesitating on the edge of the rock.</p>

<p>“Is it cold?” he asked.</p>

<p>“No; come along.”</p>

<p>He pulled his shirt slowly off. “I brought you down
some of the short stories too.”</p>

<p>I laughed. “All right; I’ll read them when I come out.”</p>

<p>But Owen was really anxious now only about the
temperature of the water. He floundered in and came up
spluttering. I was a much better swimmer than he, and
circled about him, showing off, delighting in the power<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span>
I felt. We swam out for fifty yards or so, and I timed
my stroke with Owen’s. He looked very funny. His
eyes stared straight before him as if he were set on some
desperate adventure. On our way back I splashed him a
little and he got angry, swallowing a lot of water. I told
him how contrary to the teaching of the Gospels this was;
when I asked him to drink a pint of salt water he should
swallow a quart; etc., etc.</p>

<p>When we got to the rocks and he had scrambled out,
scraping his knees and one of his elbows in doing so, for it was
not easy to get out unless you knew the way, he was quite
offended, and would hardly speak to me. I was shaking
with laughter, but I said I was sorry and gave him some
sticking-plaster. He took the sticking-plaster, but would
have none of my sympathy, and on the way home I had to
soothe him into a better temper. Then, as usual, the cloud
passed quite suddenly, and he was all right. As we drew
near the house I wondered, uneasily, what he would think
of my father, and what he would think of my home. Before
coming to us he had been staying in Scotland with people
who had evidently possessed yachts and motor-cars and all
kinds of things, whereas we could not even boast a spare
bed, and he would have to sleep with me.</p>

<p>When we came in, I introduced him to my father, who
was working in the garden, and before dinner was over I
was delighted to see that they were going to get on well
together. Owen seemed to notice none of his peculiar
habits, or, if he did, he was perfectly indifferent to them.
He displayed an extraordinary interest in the school, asking
all kinds of questions, and bringing out his own theories of
education, which may or may not have emanated from the
sage in Russia. I let them talk together without interfering
much. I could see that my father was very favourably
impressed, though the fact that such an admirable youth
happened to be a particular friend of mine was naturally<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span>
perplexing. Owen was frightfully polite. He called my
father “Sir,” and listened deferentially to everything he
had to say, never offering his own opinion as of any particular
value. They talked almost exclusively of education.
Owen told how he was teaching a boy at home in the evenings,
the son of their coachman, and how clever this boy
was, and how he had got Mr. Gill senior to promise to pay
his college fees if he did well at school during the next year
or two. It was the first time I had heard of the matter,
but I supposed it was the mysterious something which had
interfered with his own work, and had made him so anxious
about retaining his exhibition. “Didn’t <em>he</em> do splendidly?”
Owen said suddenly, nodding his head in my direction.</p>

<p>“Peter can be clever enough when he chooses,” my father
answered dryly.</p>

<p>This was to prevent me from exaggerating the merit of
my achievement, but I did not care, for in my own mind my
performance was somewhat stale already, and I did not give
a fig for such distinctions. It occurred to me, as I watched
them and listened to them, that Owen and my father were
perhaps more alike, mentally and spiritually, than Owen
and I, though my father had but a fraction of Owen’s fineness,
and none of his generosity. They were related as a
coarse weed and a delicate flower might be, but I was of a
different genus. And then I thought that, though I cared
little for Gerald, and loved Owen, perhaps it was Gerald with
whom I had really most in common.</p>

</div>


<p>Owen and I were standing by the low sea-wall, looking out
across the wet brown sands, when I saw her. It was a gray,
cloudy day, and the air was full of mist and damp, which
hung in heavy, livid-coloured veils over the black mountain-tops,
and sometimes dropped half way down the slopes.
The tide was out and the noise of the waves sounded remote
and musical. The broad stretch of wet sand and shingle
reached out to the cold, gray-green sea, with its white curling
line of foam; and at the water’s edge, a little bent forward,
her light dress floating out behind her in the fresh wind, one
hand raised, holding the brim of her big black hat, she
moved along, a solitary figure against the broad line of
sea and sky. It was Katherine, and as I watched her it
struck me that the whole picture, from her presence in it,
became curiously like a Whistler water-colour. The next
thing I noticed was that Katherine was quite grown-up,
which had the effect of producing in me a sudden shyness,
so that I made no attempt to go to meet her. Yet here was
the meeting I had lain awake half the night imagining! I
had an almost overpowering impulse to turn tail and slink
away, and perhaps I might have done so had I been
alone.</p>

<p>Owen, who took no more interest in girls than in octogenarians,
asked me what I was staring at.</p>

<p>“At Miss Dale,” I answered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[254]</span></p>

<p>“Who’s Miss Dale?”</p>

<p>“Katherine.”</p>

<p>“And who is Katherine?”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Carroll’s niece.”</p>

<p>Then Owen looked at me in surprise. “Aren’t you going
to speak to her? I thought you knew her very well?”</p>

<p>“So I do.”</p>

<p>We clambered over the wall and crossed the beach to
intercept her path. My idiotic nervousness was increased
by Owen’s presence. She had noticed our approach now,
and altered her own course to meet us. As she came up
she smiled with her bright frank smile and held out her
hand. She was perfectly natural and easy in her greeting,
while I began to stammer and splutter. I managed to
introduce Owen, saying he had come down yesterday, and
we all three walked on together.</p>

<p>“I wondered if I should see you,” she said. “We
arrived this morning. Gerald is up at the house, but I had
to come out and get some fresh air after our travels.”</p>

<p>“There’s p—plenty of it at all events,” I stuttered.</p>

<p>“I like it. I like wind,” she added, turning her smile
upon Owen. “Don’t you? It’s very nice to be back here
again. I always love coming back to any place I know.”</p>

<p>“When the tide is out it looks like a Whistler water-colour,”
I went on, thinking it a pity that this should be lost.</p>

<p>But probably neither Katherine nor Owen had ever
heard of Whistler. “It looks to me very like rain,” said the
former, glancing at the heavy clouds over Slieve Donard.
Owen took no notice at all of my remark. “Conversation
means nothing to Owen,” I reflected, impatiently,
“unless it takes the form of argument. Anything merely
suggestive or decorative is lost upon him.” And I felt
annoyed because they had both begun to chatter commonplaces
about Katherine’s journey—what kind of passage
she had had; as if it mattered!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span></p>

<p>Then I became lost in contemplation of her. A year had
certainly made a tremendous difference! “Last winter she
probably came out,” I said to myself, with vague memories
of Miss Broughton’s novels. At all events, in twelve months
she had managed to put at least five years between us.
It was quite conceivable that she was already engaged
to be married, while I was but a timid school-boy, who
could only envy from afar the happiness of her lover. And
the thought that perhaps there <em>was</em> a lover cast a vivid
illumination on my own feeling for her, made plainer than
ever the difference, how carefully veiled soever, between
friendship and love. I loved her with that love which,
idealize it as I might, was really the expression of a simple
law of nature.</p>

<p>Meanwhile she was talking to Owen, who was explaining
to her some theory of the influence of the tides upon the
earth, and of the moon on the tides. How, in the first five
minutes, he had contrived to get on to such a subject I could
not guess. It was fearfully like him, nevertheless, and
Katherine appeared to be interested.</p>

<p>No matter in what company he found himself Owen never
talked about anything except the things he was interested
in. Last night it had been a little delicious to hear him
discuss Plato’s “Republic” with Miss Dick, who, though
immensely pleased, was always at her silliest when taken
seriously. To converse with Miss Dick was like trying to
get a definite impression from a kaleidoscope; you no sooner
fixed your attention on one particular idea than it dissolved
into something quite different. And yet Miss Dick had
views—political, religious, social,—derived from a deceased
parent, who had been an apostle of free thought. Only she
would interrupt her expression of the profoundest of these
to wonder if Sissie McIldowie was really engaged to young
Stevenson.</p>

<p>And now Owen was talking to Katherine about the tides.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span>
I watched her and knew she liked him. She liked his
rough brown mane, his clear eyes, with their kindness and
innocence, for Owen, in spite of the “Kreutzer Sonata” and
the rest, was as innocent as a child. There was something
fine about Owen, and it was very visible in his face.</p>

<p>At present he quite monopolized the conversation, turning
it into a sort of scientific discourse; and I knew so well
that he had been reading some little book about tides—probably
in the train on his way down. I yawned two or
three times when he looked in my direction, but I might
have spared myself the rudeness, for it had not the slightest
effect upon him while Katherine kept on asking questions
as if she found what he said absorbing. My apparent
indifference simply had the result of producing a <i lang="fr">tête-à-tête</i>
between them.</p>

<p>“You ought to become a University Extension lecturer,”
I said, maliciously. “You should write and ask Tolstoy
about it.”</p>

<p>It was a highly disagreeable remark to make, and as soon
as I had said it I was filled with shame. Owen coloured
and stopped talking at once. I was very sorry. Inwardly
I went down on my knees to him and begged his pardon, but
outwardly I showed only a sullen stolidity. I said something
to Katherine, but she answered coldly, and turned
again to Owen as if to make up to him for my bad manners.
And at this my remorse degenerated into sulkiness.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, as we walked home together, I had the
grace to apologize. “I’m sorry for what I said,” I muttered.
“It was a most beastly thing to say. It’s not so much
because it was rude as because it was rotten.”</p>

<p>This distinction I cannot undertake here to explain; let
it suffice that in my mind it was a very clearly defined one.</p>

<p>“Oh, it doesn’t matter,” said Owen. “I always do talk
either too much or too little.”</p>

<p>After tea we went for a long walk and discussed all our<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[257]</span>
old subjects. But in my present mood they bored me,
though I was determined not to show it. What I really
wanted just then was to be alone, that I might recall the
past and make plans for the future. We went to bed when
we came in, but long after Owen had dropped asleep I lay
awake, wrapped in beautiful, desolating dreams. I gave
Owen a gentle kick, for he had begun to snore, which
troubled the quiet that was necessary for the perfect enjoyment
of my visions. It woke him up, which was not what
I had intended, but it couldn’t be helped, and, before he had
dropped asleep again, I was myself lost in slumber.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XLIV">CHAPTER XLIV</h2>
</div>


<p>I happened on the thing by the merest accident. My father
had been going through the papers in his desk the night
before, tying up old letters in bundles, and burning many in
the grate. He had been quite absorbed in this dusty task
when Owen and I had come in from our walk, and he had
been still absorbed in it when we had left him and gone up to
bed. This afternoon we were to call for the Dales, and Owen
was waiting for me now in the garden, sitting on the wall,
nibbling nasturtium leaves, whistling, and swinging his legs
to and fro, while I, having broken my shoe-lace, was in the
parlour replacing it. And as I bent down, through the tail
of my eye I caught a glimpse of something white between
the desk and the wall. I laced up my shoe, and then,
pushing the desk further to one side, with the help of the
poker I fished out an envelope. There was no writing on
this envelope, and the flap was loose, but inside I felt something
stiff and flat, like a card or a photograph. I pulled it
out. It was a photograph, considerably faded, and certainly
most astonishing if it had fallen from my father’s desk, as I
supposed it must have. For it represented a person very
much like the ladies in the chorus at the Christmas pantomime
I had gone to see with George—better looking, possibly,
than most of them, but similarly clad, in doublet and tights,
and with a velvet cap, with a cock’s feather stuck in it, set
rakishly at the side of a curly head. The face wore the
conventional simper such faces seem naturally to assume in
the presence of photographers, displaying an admirable set
of teeth. A sword dangled from the waist, a short cloak<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[259]</span>
hung from the shoulders, and the right hand was raised to
the cap in a dashing and coquettish salute. There was
something so comical in the idea of my father, of all persons
in the world, having treasured up this souvenir of what I
took to be a youthful flight of fancy, that I laughed aloud,
and was on the point of calling in Owen to show it to him,
when I turned the photograph round and on the back read,
in a sprawling feminine hand, “From Milly.”</p>

<p>I stopped short. Owen was still kicking his heels against
the whitewashed wall, still whistling, but I did not disturb
him. I heard my father coming downstairs, and my first
impulse was to cram both envelope and photograph into my
pocket. I heard him in the hall, I heard him turn the handle
of the parlour door, and then I went to meet him.</p>

<p>“I found this,” I said, “on the floor.” And I held it out
to him.</p>

<p>My father glanced at it indifferently, but when he saw
what it was a faint flush crept into his face. It was the first
time I had ever seen him change colour. He took it from
me without a word, and, putting it back in its envelope,
unlocked the desk. He opened a drawer somewhere, and
I saw him, still without speaking, slip in the envelope.
Then he pulled down the lid of the desk, which shut with a
sharp click, and turned to me.</p>

<p>“Do you know who it was?” he asked, abruptly.</p>

<p>I stammered and blushed. “I’m not sure—I think—
Wasn’t it mamma?”</p>

<p>He turned away without answering. “Owen is waiting
for you,” he said, as I still hung about nervously. “I
suppose you won’t be in for tea?”</p>

<p>“No,” I replied, and went out to my friend.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry for keeping you,” I apologized; and as we
walked round to Derryaghy I half thought of telling him of
the incident.</p>

<p>And my mother? I had known vaguely that she had been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[260]</span>
on the stage in some not particularly brilliant capacity, but
somehow the real thing, in all its callous actuality, to have that
suddenly thrust upon one, was very different. I did not like it.</p>

<p>Visions of the girls I had seen in the pantomime kept
rising before me with a disagreeable relevancy. They
strutted before my mind’s eye just as they had strutted,
jaunty and assured, about the stage, their eyes boldly seeking
the male occupants of boxes. They swaggered by me
with a peculiar movement of the hips, a perfect self-confidence;
one of them even winked as she passed. And I
saw their fat legs, their bold eyes; I heard them laugh, and
sing idiotic songs, in shrill falsetto, about Bertie, and Charlie,
and latch-keys, and staying out till three.</p>

<p>I wished I had never found my mother’s portrait, though
I tried to persuade myself that she only looked like that
because she was dressed up for the theatre, and that in
ordinary dress she must have been quite different. But
my attempts to <em>see</em> her as different failed. I had nothing
to go upon, no memories, no other portrait; for me tights
and doublet would remain her perpetual garb. I was not
disillusioned, for I had had no illusions—that is to say, I had
thought very little about the matter—but I was certainly
shocked. I remembered Mrs. Carroll’s reserve on the few
occasions when I had questioned her. Mrs. Carroll must
have known, and so must Miss Dick.</p>

<p>It was, doubtless, fortunate that I had never built up
any imaginary and sentimental picture of my mother, as
I might easily have done. Mrs. Carroll’s presence in my
life probably had prevented this.</p>

<p>“Here we are,” cried Owen, catching me by the arm.
“Wake up. I suppose you don’t know that you’ve been
fast asleep all the way!”</p>

<p>We found Katherine at the lodge, talking to the gardener’s
wife, a stout, ruddy young woman, with a flaxen-headed
little fellow clutching her by the skirts, one of my father’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"></a>[261]</span>
youthful scholars, or, more likely, one of Miss McWaters’,
since he was still at the age when problems connected with
“twice times” awaken bewildering difficulties.</p>

<p>We stopped and joined in the conversation.</p>

<p>“Isn’t your brother coming?” Owen asked, after a
minute or two.</p>

<p>“He said he was. He’s up at the house; he’s got some
new music.” Katherine smiled at me. “Do you mind
hurrying him up? It’s a shame to bother you, but if nobody
fetches him he’ll never come.”</p>

<p>I complied with an extremely bad grace. It seemed to
me I was always chosen for these messages. If Gerald
didn’t like to come himself, why couldn’t he be left behind?
I knew the others wouldn’t even wait for us; in fact, when
I turned round, they had already begun to walk on slowly.</p>

<p>I found Gerald busy with his music, and not looking in
the least as if he intended to be anything else but busy with
it all the afternoon. “The others are waiting,” I said,
with sulky abruptness. “Are you ready?”</p>

<p>He raised his head and his brown eyes rested on mine
curiously. “They won’t wait very long,” he replied. “Do
you really want to climb that ridiculous mountain?”</p>

<p>I looked down sullenly. “Why not? We arranged to
do so, didn’t we? Owen wants to.”</p>

<p>“Let them go alone, then. They’ve begun to study
botany. Katherine was examining things through a little
lens all yesterday evening.”</p>

<p>His drawling irony made me furious. “We must go,”
I said, shortly. I knew well enough that he knew what was
passing in my mind, and that I had been fighting against
it for the last fortnight. He was the only one, I fondly
imagined, who <em>did</em> know, and I had begun to think that
the spectacle of my jealousy was pleasing to him, and that
he had his own delicate ways of encouraging it. He did not
like Owen, yet, for some reason I could not fathom, he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[262]</span>
appeared to regard favourably his friendship with Katherine.
That friendship had made astonishing strides in the past
week or two. When we went anywhere together now, it
was invariably Owen who was Katherine’s escort. Things
seemed to arrange themselves naturally in that way, and
this afternoon was no exception.</p>

<p>It was not till I told him I would follow the others, and
was leaving the room, that Gerald made up his mind to
accompany me, and even then, about a quarter way up
Slieve Donard, he announced that he had gone far enough
and would wait here till they came down. Owen and
Katherine were not in sight, for Gerald had made the ascent
at the pace of the pilgrims in “Tannhäuser,” and I had had
to keep with him. He stretched himself full length on the
grass, and, as if it were an amusing question, asked me what
I proposed doing. I did not know myself whether to wait
with him here or to finish the climb. I stood hesitating,
with a face like a thunder-cloud.</p>

<p>“I suppose they’re at the top by this time,” said Gerald,
casually, and his supposition decided me.</p>

<p>I climbed up alone and full of bitter thoughts. Presently
I saw Owen and Katherine far above me, but they never
once looked back. I remembered that day, long ago it now
seemed when Katherine and I had climbed the hill from the
Bloody Bridge Valley, and how I had helped her over rough
places, as I supposed Owen was helping her now, and walked
hand in hand with her.</p>

<p>When I reached the summit I saw them standing together
under the lee of a huge gray rock, gazing seaward. They
heard my approach and turned round.</p>

<p>“Where did you leave Gerald?” Katherine asked,
amused. “I didn’t think he would get very far!”</p>

<p>“You might have waited for me then,” I answered
gruffly. “You were in a mighty hurry to start.”</p>

<p>It gave me a sort of stupid pleasure to think I was showing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"></a>[263]</span>
by my manner that I considered myself neglected, so I
proceeded deliberately to be as unpleasant as possible.
That I had joined them had obviously not annoyed them
in the least—Katherine had certainly shown no annoyance
when she had greeted me—yet I told myself that this was
only pretence, and that they wished me away. And then,
as I thought how there might have been some secret understanding
between them, and that perhaps Katherine had
arranged to be down at the lodge when we arrived so that
she might send me back to the house for Gerald, I felt—though
I really did not believe in any such scheming—a
violent anger against them both. When she saw the kind
of humour I was in, Katherine ceased to take any notice of
me, and this made me worse. I had not sense enough
to leave them. A kind of perversity seemed to force me to
do everything I could to make myself objectionable. I
had an insane desire to quarrel with Owen, and presently
I contradicted him flatly when he said something I knew
to be perfectly true. He flushed and his eyes brightened
angrily, but he controlled himself. “What is the matter
with you, Peter?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Nothing,” I muttered.</p>

<p>I bounded away from them. I ran down the mountain-side
at the risk of breaking an ankle, leaping from one point
to another. I did not pause when I came to where Gerald
lay in the grass, but continued my headlong descent till I
reached the woods. I had come down in an incredibly
short time, and the violence of my flight had relieved me.
I walked now at an ordinary pace, wondering what the
others would think, conscious that I had made a fool of
myself, yet laying all the blame on Katherine.</p>

<p>The woods were silent save for the occasional note of a
robin or the low twitter of a swallow. I stopped by a
marshy hollow to look at a vivid splash of yellow irises, and
I gathered an armful of them for Mrs. Carroll.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XLV">CHAPTER XLV</h2>
</div>


<p>Owen and I dined at Derryaghy that night, but all through
dinner I sat very quiet. No allusion was made by the
others to my having left them, which showed, I thought,
that they had discussed it among themselves and had agreed
not to take any notice.</p>

<p>After dinner Gerald stayed behind to smoke a cigarette,
and I stayed with him. When we followed the others to
the drawing-room, he went to the piano and began to play.
Owen sat by the window looking out. He had not once
spoken to me since I had left him and Katherine at the top
of Slieve Donard; I thought he had even avoided meeting
my glance, but I was not sure. Katherine and Miss Dick
had each some needlework. Mrs. Carroll was not with us.
From my corner of the room I watched Katherine as she
worked, her beautiful head bowed in the lamp-light, and
secretly, in my soul, I knew Owen was more fitted to be her
mate than I. It is true, I did not believe he could love her
so intensely, but the love he gave her would be more unselfish.
I became lost in gloomy thoughts. I knew they
both belonged to a world where I was a stranger, an outcast.
In that hour I recognized my moral inferiority to Owen, and
suddenly I felt how peaceful and quiet it would be in the
thick darkness, with the grass over my head, and everything
finished and forgotten.</p>

<p>Gerald had begun to play the “Moonlight Sonata,”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[265]</span>
Chopinizing it, as he did everything, and perhaps this
unhappy vision came to me from his music. At all events, it
hovered before me in an intensity of sadness beneath which
I shut my eyes. I got up by-and-by and crossed the room
to where Katherine sat at her work. I pulled forward a
chair and sat down near to her, and with my back to the
others, so that what I said should be heard by her alone.</p>

<p>“Will you come out with me?” I asked, in a low voice.</p>

<p>“Out? <em>Now</em>, do you mean?” She looked up in surprise,
but she also spoke in lowered tones, and with, I
thought, a certain coldness. At this my anger was stirred
afresh.</p>

<p>“Now,” I answered.</p>

<p>She seemed on the point of refusing. “Are you afraid?”
I sneered.</p>

<p>She appeared not to understand me. “Afraid! What
is there to be afraid of?” After a moment she decided.
“I will come in a minute or two; I want to finish this
flower.”</p>

<p>She returned perfectly calmly to her work. She was
embroidering a table-cloth for her mother’s birthday, and
was always saying she should never have it finished in time.
I, with a burning heart, got up and strolled out on to the
terrace, my hands in my pockets, and whistling below my
breath, which I imagined lent an air of off-handedness to my
exit. Once beyond the windows, however, my whistling
ceased abruptly, and I hurried round to the other side of the
house, where I waited in a fever till she should come.</p>

<p>She did not keep me long. She had not put on a hat, nor
even a loose wrap about her shoulders; evidently she intended
our interview to be a short one. I hastened from
the shadow to meet her.</p>

<p>“Do you know what I want?” I began gloomily.</p>

<p>“You want to speak to me about something, I suppose?”
Again I was conscious of a coldness in her voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266"></a>[266]</span></p>

<p>“Yes. I have so few opportunities now.”</p>

<p>“I think you have plenty of opportunities, considering
you see me every day.”</p>

<p>We walked on slowly, side by side. “Are you angry with
me?” I asked, trying to speak penitently.</p>

<p>“About what?”</p>

<p>There was something in her air of calm deliberation that
held me at a distance.</p>

<p>“Everything—this afternoon, for instance.”</p>

<p>“I thought you weren’t very nice to your friend.”</p>

<p>“I wasn’t. Nor to you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it doesn’t matter about me.”</p>

<p>“Why?” I asked miserably.</p>

<p>“Well, it doesn’t matter so much. I’m not your guest—and—I
don’t suppose I’m as fond of you as he is.”</p>

<p>There was something cruel in those last words, though
their cruelty may have been unconscious. For a minute or
two I could not speak.</p>

<p>“Why have you changed, Katherine?” I said at length,
my voice still not very secure.</p>

<p>“It is you who have changed.”</p>

<p>“Have I?”</p>

<p>“You were not like this last summer.”</p>

<p>“I think I was.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what it is, but there is a difference. I
suppose it may be only that you are growing up. I like
people to be either men or boys. Why can’t you be natural?
Why can’t you be content to be as you were?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think you have treated me fairly.”</p>

<p>“I can’t help it. Why should you be so jealous? It’s
horrid. Everything is changed, as you say. It is not nearly
so nice. I first began to notice it in your letters, but I
thought when I saw you it would be all right. If I had
known you were going to be like this I wouldn’t have come at
all.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>[267]</span></p>

<p>There was something in her manner I couldn’t understand,
something mysterious, as if her words hid a regret, though
whether it was for our old friendship or not I could not say.</p>

<p>“Tell me what it is you don’t like,” I said, thickly.</p>

<p>Katherine’s dark blue eyes rested on me while she hesitated.
“I can’t. I’m stupid. Perhaps I don’t really
know myself.” Then suddenly she broke out, “Don’t
speak to me or I shall cry or do something idiotic. Let us
go back.” Without waiting for me she began to walk
hastily in the direction of the house. I ran after her; I
was lost in wonderment; but I made no attempt to detain
her or to question her.</p>

<p>No allusion was made to our absence when we returned to
the others. Gerald was still playing, but he got up as soon
as we entered, and strolled over to the window, where he
stood beside Owen, looking out.</p>

<p>“There should be white peacocks here,” he murmured
idly. “I’ve always longed to live in a house where there
were white peacocks. They are the most poetic creatures
in the world. They come over the lawn in the moonlight,
delightful fowls, and knock with their beaks against the
windows to be fed. They love moonlight. They’re extraordinarily
morbid and decadent. Their only quite healthy
taste is that they want to be fed. Shouldn’t you like them,
Miss Dick?”</p>

<p>Miss Dick, to whom all Gerald’s words were pearls of
wisdom, listened to these with close attention. “I’ll speak
to Mrs. Carroll about them,” she said. “It <em>would</em> be nice
to have them.”</p>

<p>Gerald smiled sweetly, and Owen moved away from him,
an expression on his face of mingled contempt and disgust,
which, had I not been so miserable, I should have found
highly comic. There was nothing, I knew, irritated him
more than this kind of talk, which Gerald manufactured with
extreme ingenuity, principally for Owen’s benefit. For
Owen’s sake he would talk in a world-weary fashion of the
“colour” of life, and ever since he had discovered that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"></a>[269]</span>
word “Philistine” was peculiarly exasperating, it had
figured more frequently than any other in his conversation.
He dragged it in at every turn, nearly always with absolute
irrelevancy. He began to talk of Philistines now, à propos
of some concert at which he declared he had been asked to
play—a concert he had probably invented for the occasion.</p>

<p>Owen stood with his back against the chimney-piece, his
eyes bright, his cheeks red. “There is one class, at any
rate, that is a good deal more disgusting than your Philistines—the
people who imagine themselves superior to
them.”</p>

<p>But Gerald could keep perfectly cool. “These people
you mention,” he began in his most elaborate manner, “I
strongly suspect to be only the commanders of the Philistine
hosts—their Tolstoys, their chief-priests and scribes.
It is the Philistine who imagines himself superior to other
Philistines. This is the one flight his imagination is capable
of. The artist may be superior, but that, I think, is not
what you mean?”</p>

<p>“You’re right,” said Owen, fiercely, “it’s not what I
mean. And I suppose <em>you</em> are an artist?”</p>

<p>“My dear Gill, it is apparent.”</p>

<p>“I’m not your dear Gill,” said Owen, who had lost his
temper.</p>

<p>“Shut up, Owen,” I interrupted. “What’s the use of
taking everything so seriously?”</p>

<p>“Because everything <em>is</em> serious. You may say a lot of
chatter about white peacocks and Philistines doesn’t mean
anything if you like, but it does. It is a mask for other
things that are real enough—for selfishness, and immorality.”</p>

<p>We all gazed at him in silence, almost open-mouthed,
Gerald with a faint smile on his handsome face. Miss Dick
alone found it incumbent upon her to say something, and
she remarked that the Charity Organization Committee to
which she belonged had been able to do a great deal, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270"></a>[270]</span>
that the lecture with lime-light views had brought in over
three pounds—she meant even after all expenses had been
paid.</p>

<p>These observations could not fill up the breach. Nobody,
indeed, took any notice of them. Katherine had laid down
her work, and her eyes were fixed on Owen’s angry face,
with, I thought, an expression of admiration and sympathy.</p>

<p>“What has morality to do with art?” Gerald asked
calmly. “Peter supports you because he is not an artist, but
only a person of taste, who likes to listen to my playing. I
<em>am</em> an artist, and I know. You not being even a person of—I
beg your pardon—you being a person of different
tastes from Peter, and uninterested in art, naturally are at
a disadvantage when you discuss it. I do not mean that
rudely; I say it merely in self-defence. Is anyone coming
down in the direction of the station?”</p>

<p>He went out, but nobody offered to accompany him.</p>

<p>Owen and I left shortly afterwards. He was very quiet as
we walked home, but when we were in bed he said to me,
“I’ve decided to go back to town to-morrow.”</p>

<p>I heard the words with a thrill of mingled pleasure and
misgiving. “To-morrow? Why?” I asked. “You must
stay till the end of the week in any case.” Then something
made me add, “Is it because I was rude to you this afternoon?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>I thought for a little. “Has that nothing to do with it?”
I persisted.</p>

<p>“No; at least, not directly. I may as well be quite
frank about it. I know you would rather I went; that is
my reason. I ought to have seen it before, but I didn’t,
though I had a kind of feeling several times that there was
something wrong. It is partly your own fault that I didn’t
guess sooner. You always mentioned Katherine as if you
were quite indifferent to her; and that first day you seemed
even to hesitate about going to speak to her. I remember
now what you told me on the night of our party, but until
to-day I never connected it with her.”</p>

<p>“You think I’m jealous?” I said in a low voice.</p>

<p>“I know you are, but I didn’t know it until this afternoon.
Don’t imagine I’m offended or any silly rot of that kind.
There is no reason why I should be. Of course I should<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272"></a>[272]</span>
have liked it better if you had told me openly—but—well,
it doesn’t matter. I don’t understand your feeling, but
that doesn’t matter, either; if you have it, it is enough. I
like Katherine, I like her very much, but, after all, it is you
who are my friend.”</p>

<p>“She won’t want you to go,” I said miserably. At that
moment I certainly preferred Owen to Katherine.</p>

<p>“She won’t mind very much, and I really can’t knock
about with her brother. I hate the very sight of him.”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t we knock about by ourselves?”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid it would hardly do to drop them now.”</p>

<p>There was a silence.</p>

<p>“Owen?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what to do.”</p>

<p>“About what?”</p>

<p>“About anything. About your going away. About
Katherine.”</p>

<p>“But when I’m away won’t it be all right?”</p>

<p>“No; it will be all wrong. I’ve been beastly to you as it
is. And she doesn’t like me—I mean she only likes me
middling—not even as much as she did—she told me so, this
evening.”</p>

<p>“But you will have plenty of time to make it up.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t that—it isn’t that we’ve quarrelled. And the
other—it is no use—it only irritates me. I wish I could
explain. Things—things come into my mind.”</p>

<p>Owen was silent.</p>

<p>“And I’ve been beastly to you,” I went on.</p>

<p>“Oh, nonsense.”</p>

<p>He was silent again till he said, “There’s one way, but I
know you won’t take it.”</p>

<p>“What is it?”</p>

<p>“Come back with me, and spend the rest of your holidays
with me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273"></a>[273]</span></p>

<p>I lay quiet.</p>

<p>“Will you?”</p>

<p>In the dark I shook my head. Then, remembering he
could not see me, I answered, “No: I can’t.”</p>

<p>“Why not? It is only a matter of will.”</p>

<p>“But I haven’t any will, except to get what I want.”</p>

<p>“You could try it for a few days.”</p>

<p>“No. There are not a great many days altogether.
They will be leaving before the end of the month.”</p>

<p>“Well, if you should change your mind, come at any time—I
mean without bothering to write.”</p>

<p>“Very well.”</p>

<p>Owen was silent so long that I thought he had dropped
asleep, when suddenly he spoke again.</p>

<p>“Peter?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know if you were asleep or not. It is this. I
wrote to my people about you—about your having to go to
lodgings when you come up to town after summer; and
they want you to come to live with us.”</p>

<p>I felt myself grow hot with shame.</p>

<p>“You see there are plenty of bedrooms,” Owen went on,
“and my study, I daresay, would do for both of us to work
in. I hope you’ll come: they all want you to. If you
think of it I’ll speak to your father; but of course if you’d
rather be in ‘digs’ by yourself, it would be better for me not
to mention it to him.”</p>

<p>“Do you really want me to come?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Of course I want you.”</p>

<p>“I mean, do you really and truly want me?”</p>

<p>He laughed pleasantly. “Of course I really and truly
want you.”</p>

<p>“You’re not doing it out of kindness or anything like
that?”</p>

<p>“The kindness will be all on your side.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>[274]</span></p>

<p>“No: but I mean it. You must tell me.”</p>

<p>“I suggested it because I’d like to have you. I wasn’t
a bit sure whether you’d come or not. My reason for asking
you is exactly the same as my reason for asking you every
Sunday to come for a walk with me.”</p>

<p>“I’ll come,” I said. “Thanks awfully.” But my pleasure
was spoiled by the remorse I felt for my own conduct as
host. It seemed to me I was a fairly second-rate specimen
of humanity, hardly good enough to be taken out and
drowned.</p>

<p>I do not know whether Katherine attributed Owen’s sudden
departure to me or not, but I think it extremely probable
that she did, although she never mentioned it. Yet we
sometimes spoke of Owen himself during the days that followed.
In those days we slipped back more or less into our
former friendship, and I tried to feel that it was just the
same. Yet something of the old freedom had gone, and I
could not forget what Katherine had said to me the night
before Owen’s departure. After a few days, indeed, it
came into my romantic mind that there might be another
interpretation of her behaviour on that occasion, one I
hardly dared even to dream of, so much was it what I desired.
But it influenced me nevertheless. I longed to have another
day alone with her—a day such as we had had last
year, and I determined to ask her to come somewhere with
me alone, to come, that is, without Gerald.</p>

<p>I went up to Derryaghy one afternoon with this intention,
and was shown into the morning-room, where I found Mrs.
Carroll and Miss Dick. Mrs. Carroll informed me that
Katherine had been washing her hair, and was now drying
it at the kitchen fire. She told me to go on in if I wanted to
speak to her, but I hung back bashfully. In the end I
went, all the same, and discovered Katherine sitting on a
stool, a book open on her knee, and her long, thick, dark
brown hair hanging loose in the red glow of the kitchen range.</p>

<p>“It’s well for you you haven’t to undergo torments of
this kind!” she exclaimed. “I was baked nearly ten<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>[276]</span>
minutes ago. My hair was simply full of salt. I don’t
know how it gets in under my bathing-cap.”</p>

<p>The situation may seem more homely than romantic, but
I thought she looked extremely lovely, and gazed at her in
silent admiration. Perhaps she noticed it, for she coloured
as she laughed.</p>

<p>“My dear Peter, aren’t you going to say good-morning
to me? I’m not the Sleeping Beauty, you know?”</p>

<p>“What beautiful hair you have,” I said, in an awed tone,
and involuntarily I touched it with my hand.</p>

<p>She laughed again, but drew back. “Did you come in
just to admire it? It’s very nice of you.”</p>

<p>“I came to ask you to go for a walk with me this
afternoon, round by the Hilltown Road—by the road under
the mountains—just you by yourself.”</p>

<p>“‘Me by myself!’ When do you want to go?”</p>

<p>“After lunch.”</p>

<p>“Very well—if it’s not too hot.”</p>

<p>The readiness with which she consented made me consider
myself a fool for not having asked her sooner, and I began to
regret all my lost opportunities.</p>

<p>On my way home I met Gerald, who wanted to know if I
had bathed yet.</p>

<p>“I bathed before breakfast. Where have you been?”</p>

<p>“Oh, just down to the Club House.”</p>

<p>I turned back with him. I had made up my mind to say
something he might possibly resent, but I plunged into my
subject without beating about the bush. “Don’t you think
you are rather a fool to go down there so often?”</p>

<p>“Down where?” asked Gerald. “To the Club House?”</p>

<p>“Yes; though I was thinking more of the hotel. It
seems to me you go to the hotel nearly every evening now.”</p>

<p>He smiled, indifferently. “There’s nothing else to do.”</p>

<p>“It seems stupid to chum up with people about twice
your age,” I persisted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277"></a>[277]</span></p>

<p>“They’re not twice my age. Some of them aren’t very
much older than I am. What harm does it do?”</p>

<p>“Well, I was only with you once, but I didn’t like what I
saw there, especially towards the end of the evening.”</p>

<p>“What didn’t you like, Peter?” he asked, good-humouredly.</p>

<p>“I thought it looked silly—and a little disgusting. There
were you, a chap barely eighteen, calling Captain Denby,
who’s about fifty, by his Christian name. You must know
well enough that he’s as gross as a pig. What does he care
about your playing? And what pleasure, anyway, can it
give you to play a lot of waltzes and popular songs?”</p>

<p>“He cares as much for my playing as you do.”</p>

<p>“My dear Gerald, if you think that you’re a fool.”</p>

<p>“You sat quiet enough at the time. You were afraid to
open your mouth.”</p>

<p>“That may be so, but it doesn’t alter the fact that I was
infinitely superior to anyone in that room except yourself.”</p>

<p>“I daresay you were, Peter. I never doubt your superiority.
There’s one thing you forget, however, and that
is that any friendship there may be between you and me is a
pretty one-sided affair.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” I asked, uncomfortably.</p>

<p>“Only that you’ve never given it much encouragement.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, I’m sure. Partly, I should think, because
you rather dislike me. That always stands in the way of
such things.”</p>

<p>His irony rang unpleasantly true. “Why should you
think I dislike you?” I said, very weakly.</p>

<p>“It would take too long to explain. It never gave me
any particular pleasure to think so—at first, just the reverse—and
I mention it now merely at your request.”</p>

<p>I didn’t quite know what to say. “Isn’t my speaking
to you about this matter a proof of my not disliking you?”
I risked. “I thought we had always been friends.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"></a>[278]</span></p>

<p>“No, Peter, your friend is a prig called Owen Gill.”</p>

<p>“Owen isn’t a prig,” I said warmly, glad to have a chance
to put him in the wrong, but my chance did not last.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon,” said Gerald, “even if he was, I
shouldn’t have called him one to you.”</p>

<p>“Better say it to me, if you’re going to say it at all. I can
defend him.”</p>

<p>“I daresay there is no harm in being a prig.”</p>

<p>“Owen is a good deal finer chap than either you or I.”</p>

<p>“And yet neither of us would change with him! But the
point is hardly worth discussing.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to discuss it.”</p>

<p>“You want to give me good advice? Well, fire ahead.”</p>

<p>“Oh, there’s no use in my saying anything. You know
it all well enough yourself, and if you think it better to go
on as you are doing, I can’t interfere. But it seems to me
stupid to get into bad habits.”</p>

<p>“Have you no bad habits, Peter?”</p>

<p>“I’m not talking about myself.”</p>

<p>“That’s true.”</p>

<p>“You said the other night you were an artist; but you
know as well as I do, that if you are going to do anything in
that way you will have to work, and that you won’t work
if you begin to loaf about, taking drinks with this person and
that. I can’t even understand why you should want to. If <em>I</em>
had any particular gift I would cultivate it for all it was worth.”</p>

<p>“Have you no gift?”</p>

<p>“No. As you also remarked, I am a person of taste.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry if I offended you. I didn’t mean anything.”</p>

<p>“You believed it all the same.”</p>

<p>“I’m not sure that I did. You’re clever enough.”</p>

<p>“Thank you. I’ll not come any further.”</p>

<p>“Won’t you? It was good of you bothering about me,
and I took it very well, didn’t I?” He smiled.</p>

<p>“You didn’t take it at all; but that’s not my fault.”</p>

<p>It was a cloudless afternoon when I went back to Derryaghy.
Katherine was quite ready and we set out immediately. As
I walked beside her, in her simple cotton dress, and with her
gay parasol, I thought her adorable.</p>

<p>“Do you remember our picnic?” I asked, for I was for
ever harking back to it in my mind.</p>

<p>“Which? There have been so many!”</p>

<p>“I mean our own—the one we went together—the first
of all.”</p>

<p>“It seems centuries ago. I wonder if Bryansford isn’t
too far for this afternoon? The others were saying something
about driving. That would be better.”</p>

<p>“It was a day very like this,” I went on, “a perfect
summer day.” And a strange thrill passed through me as I
recalled its incidents.</p>

<p>The air was as soft as velvet. The August sun streamed
over the fields. We followed a lane which led us past a long,
low house, where an immense cherry-tree, with a trunk nine
or ten feet in circumference, spread its branches in a small
green orchard. I repeated aloud some lines of a poem I
remembered:</p>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I know a little garden-close</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Set thick with lily and red rose,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Where I would wander if I might</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">From dewy dawn to dewy night,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">And have one with me wandering.”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280"></a>[280]</span></p>

<p>Two friendly dogs wagged their tails, and a cat lounging
on the gray stone wall unclosed its eyes in sleepy yellow slits.</p>

<p>“Can’t we be friends, Katherine, as we were then?” I
pleaded.</p>

<p>“But aren’t we friends?” she asked, with a shade of
impatience in her voice.</p>

<p>“You know what I mean.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I <em>don’t</em> know what you mean, Peter.” Then
she unexpectedly added: “You’re a very queer mixture. I
often wonder how you’ll come out in the end.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t an idea,” I replied, somewhat taken aback.
The remark appeared to me peculiar, and I felt as if she had
pushed me farther away; and with this my self-confidence
began to evaporate.</p>

<p>We walked on in silence. There was, at the particular
point we had now reached, a certain grandeur in the
landscape, which even at that agitated moment impressed
me with a sense of solemnity. From childhood I had
imagined it—quite without historical foundation—as the
scene of ancient Druidical worship. I thought of the dark
soil as having drunk up the hot, sweet blood of human sacrifice,
while the “pale-eyed priest” lifted his gaze to the
clear autumn sky, and watched against it, just that same
dark curving line of quiet hills that I was watching now.</p>

<p>Yet, when we began to speak again it was of things about
which we were both profoundly indifferent, and I had a
sickening feeling that I was failing to interest my companion,
and that while she was talking to me her thoughts were
elsewhere. Somehow it appeared to be impossible to raise
our conversation out of the rut of deadly commonplace into
which it had fallen. It seemed to me almost as if Katherine
were keeping it there on purpose, and before we came to
Bryansford, I proposed trying to get tea at one of the
cottages, for I felt that any interruption would be a relief.</p>

<p>When we had finished, and paid for, our refreshment,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281"></a>[281]</span>
instead of continuing our way round under the mountains,
as I had intended, Katherine decided that we ought to start
for home.</p>

<p>“Let us at least go back through the woods,” I begged.
“We don’t want to tramp along that dusty road again.”</p>

<p>She yielded to my persuasion, and we entered the estate
that lay beyond Derryaghy. It was strangely still in the late
afternoon. Not a leaf stirred. On and on we walked,
hardly speaking, and suddenly the dead silence, and our
complete solitude, became, as it were, visible to me; and
with that there rose in my mind, with intense vividness, a
memory—the memory of Elsie at Owen’s party. The
whole thing came back to me almost with the strength of
hallucination: her lips on mine, my own kisses, her yielding
body as she closed her eyes under my embrace. I was
horribly nervous. I felt myself trembling and a faint mist
swam before my eyes. I put out my hand and tried to take
Katherine’s, but she drew away from me at once. I stopped
short, facing her, on the narrow path. “I want to speak
to you,” I said. “What have I done?”</p>

<p>She made as if to pass me, but I barred the way. I was
conscious once more, through other things, of a smouldering
anger against her. “Why do you draw back when I touch
you? You once told me you cared for me. You wrote to
me that you did.”</p>

<p>“So I do,” she answered quietly, though her face had
altered. “I don’t know what you want, nor why you
aren’t satisfied.”</p>

<p>And, all the time, that other vision was acting like an
hypnotic suggestion upon my mind. “You know that I
love you,” I persisted, hoarsely, my voice sounding queer,
though I tried to speak naturally. “Tell me, would you
rather have Owen?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think you should speak to me like this. I wish
you would allow me to pass, please.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282"></a>[282]</span></p>

<p>Her dark blue eyes were fixed on me; she was very near.
I was passionately conscious of her attraction for me; my
heart was thumping, and the blood began to drum in my
temples, while a sort of shadow veiled my sight. I threw
my arms round her; I could feel her body straining away
from me, her breath on my face. For a moment she seemed
to submit as I kissed her, but the next instant she struggled
from me, and I felt a blow across my face. She had struck
me with her parasol, which now hung broken in her hand.</p>

<p>Her eyes flashed on me like a withering fire. She was
furiously angry. “How dare you touch me! Let me pass
at once, you—you beast.”</p>

<p>My arms dropped to my sides. A sudden, bitter shame
overcame me. I saw her pass me with head erect and
flaming cheeks, and then I dropped on my face on the ground.</p>

<p>When I got up she was out of sight. I did not know how
long I had lain there, but I made no attempt to follow her.
As I brushed mechanically the earth and bits of grass and
twigs from my clothes, I felt almost dazed. It had all passed,
and I did not want to think. I heard the drowsy prattle of
a stream, and became aware that I was hot and thirsty. I
went down to it and followed the bank till I reached a deep
green pool, from which, lying flat on my belly, I drank
greedily. As I raised my head I saw my own image in the
water—my bright eyes, my dark, flushed face, my coarse,
ruffled hair.</p>

<p>I had told my father I should be dining at Derryaghy, yet he
made no remark when, instead, I came in an hour late for
tea. Fresh tea simply was prepared for me, and again,
while I sat at table, I was conscious of something peculiar
in the way he watched me, so that for an instant it even
flashed upon me that he might have heard of what had
happened in the wood.</p>

<p>It was only when I had finished eating that he spoke. “I
had a letter from your Uncle George this afternoon,” he said,
and I knew at once, not so much from his voice as from the
face he turned to me, that something serious had happened.</p>

<p>My thoughts darted straightway to Aunt Margaret, to
vague, gruesome tragedies, murder or suicide. “What’s
the matter?” I asked, uneasily. Perhaps it had to do with
little Alice? Why couldn’t he tell me at once? Then I
noticed that he had pushed a bundle of photographs to me
across the table.</p>

<p>“Do you know anything of these?” he asked, in a strange
voice.</p>

<p>I started. A glance at the top one had been sufficient.
I recognized the photographs George had kept hidden in his
room, or others like them. I looked at my father watching
me, not angrily, but in a kind of hopeless way; I looked
into his gray, still face while he went on speaking. “They
were found in your bedroom hidden under the floor. Uncle<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284"></a>[284]</span>
George says that George knows nothing about them, and,
that being the case, he felt it his duty to tell me. He does
not mention your name. I don’t know what to do. I have
been trying to think.” He looked at the wretched things,
as they lay there, with a kind of horror.</p>

<p>I sat silent for a moment. “They’re not mine,” I then
said. “I have nothing to do with them.”</p>

<p>A gleam of relief came into his face, but it faded quickly.
“You never saw them before?”</p>

<p>I lifted the top one, but immediately put it back again.
“I don’t know whether I saw them before or not,” I
answered. “If I didn’t see these particular ones I saw
others like them.” My father winced. “But they never
belonged to me. Even if I had wanted them I wouldn’t have
known where to get them.”</p>

<p>“Did you know of this hiding place?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“And of what was there?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Only you and George occupied that room.”</p>

<p>“And George says they aren’t his.” I looked towards
the window.</p>

<p>My father hesitated. Then he said solemnly, “Will you
give me your word of honour, Peter, that you had nothing
to do with their being there?”</p>

<p>“I had nothing to do with it.” I answered quietly. “I
knew they were there, because George showed them to me.
If he was here he would not say they were mine. I knew
what he was like from the first day I went there. Those
things were there then, and on the very first night he wanted
to show them to me, but he was frightened to. I did not
see them till a long time afterwards. I would never have
seen them at all, if you had let me leave when I first wrote to
ask you to.”</p>

<p>“You gave me no reason,” said my father, sadly. “Do<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285"></a>[285]</span>
you think I should have allowed you to stay an hour in the
place if I had known?”</p>

<p>“You might have guessed there was <em>some</em> reason. And
at the time I couldn’t give any—I didn’t know myself.”</p>

<p>“Had that anything to do with your not wanting to go
back there after Christmas?”</p>

<p>“In a way—more or less,” I answered. “Not exactly
that, but other things——”</p>

<p>My father sighed. He tore the photographs in two, and
placed them in the empty grate, where he set fire to them.
It was like an act of purification, and when it was concluded
he turned round and said gloomily, “I’m sorry if I misjudged
you. I accept your word.”</p>

<p>But he didn’t accept it—he couldn’t. Secretly, and underneath
everything, and, without admitting it even to himself,
he couldn’t help being doubtful, and I knew he was
doubtful. If I had suddenly told him the photographs
were mine, and expressed appropriate remorse, I believe it
would have made him happier than my denial did. As I saw
the wretchedness of his face the injustice of the whole thing
became intolerable. “Do you believe me, or do you not?”
I asked brusquely.</p>

<p>“I have told you I believe you.”</p>

<p>“You don’t look as if you did.”</p>

<p>“I can’t pretend to treat the matter as of no importance.
My believing you means that I must disbelieve George.”</p>

<p>“Why should you trouble about George? And, at any
rate, though he did have those things, he’s decent enough in
some ways. I’m pretty sure he would have burnt them
himself after a while.”</p>

<p>I’m afraid this speech did neither George nor myself any
good. It simply made my father think me callous.</p>

<p>I went out on the golf-links with Tony, and sat looking
at the sea. I began to think of my father and of the failure
of his life. This last incident seemed but to fit with all the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286"></a>[286]</span>
others into its tragic grayness. And I reflected how for
him I must compose a large part of that failure. Thinking
of me could bring him little consolation, probably just the
reverse. It was a pity. I doubtless was not, particularly
from his point of view, much to boast of, but I was better than
he thought me. I might be below the average in most
things, but I was not below it in all....</p>

<p>And then my natural egotism rose once more to the surface.
My mind turned to Katherine, and it seemed to me
I was making a horrible mess of my whole existence. I got
up and walked slowly back to the town. A wandering
troupe of open-air entertainers had arrived during the day,
and were busy erecting tents and hobby-horse machines in a
large field not far from our house. Most of the natives, both
young and old, were superintending these preparations with
an unflagging interest which had already stretched over
hours, but I was in no mood to join them. I determined to
walk as far as the pier and then go home. I had not gone
above a hundred yards when I felt my face burning. Before
me, coming in my direction, were Katherine and Gerald.
Nothing but a straight stretch of road and footpath lay
between us, and it was certain that they must have already
seen me. I would have liked to turn back, but my pride
prevented such a step, and I walked on, my head up, a
flaming blush on my face. Gerald and I raised our caps.
My eyes sought Katherine’s, but her glance just brushed
mine to rest on some distant point beyond me. The next
moment we had passed. Hot tears rose to my eyes, but I
walked as far as I had intended to. On the pier steps I sat
down and put my arms round Tony’s broad back and kissed
him. If I had committed the greatest crime on earth, I
thought, he would have licked my cheek and pretended to
bite my ear just as he did now.</p>

<p>“I want to go up to Belfast to-day,” I said to my father
next morning at breakfast.</p>

<p>His reply was exactly the one I had anticipated. “What
do you want to go to Belfast for?”</p>

<p>“I want to see Owen about something.”</p>

<p>“Hadn’t you a whole fortnight when you saw him every
day?”</p>

<p>“I want to speak to him,” I answered, very low-spiritedly.
I knew he was thinking of the railway-fare, and if I had had
any money myself I should never have asked him.</p>

<p>“Can’t you write?” he demanded, querulously.</p>

<p>“I want to speak to him.”</p>

<p>“Don’t go on repeating the same thing like a child.”</p>

<p>“But why can’t I go?” I asked helplessly.</p>

<p>“Because it is a waste of money.”</p>

<p>“It will only cost five shillings.”</p>

<p>“Five shillings is a great deal too much to spend upon
nothing.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t nothing. I want to speak to him. I never
asked to go before.”</p>

<p>“You’ll be seeing him very soon—in another fortnight—and
you will have plenty of time to talk to him then.”</p>

<p>“I want to speak to him now,” I persisted. “Can’t I
go?”</p>

<p>“Peter, you are dreadfully obstinate. What do you
want to see him about that won’t keep for a few days?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288"></a>[288]</span></p>

<p>“I sent him a telegram before breakfast, asking him to
meet me, and I can’t very well not go.”</p>

<p>“It is your own fault if you do things without consulting
me.”</p>

<p>Nevertheless, in the end, he allowed me to go, and I
caught the first train.</p>

<p>I had asked Owen to meet me in the Botanic Gardens, for
I did not want to call at his house, and, as I arrived some
few minutes before the appointed time, I began to pace
disconsolately up and down one of the paths, my head
filled with dreary thoughts. Two or three gardeners with
long rakes were raking the walks, and a man with a pair of
clippers was trimming the edges of the grass. As they
pottered over their work they carried on a disjointed conversation,
principally about religion, or rather about the
evils of Roman Catholicism. I listened to their idiotic
remarks, which at another time might have amused me.
The man with the clippers was describing some form of
service which he called “High Rosary,” and the rakers
from time to time interpolated words and grunts. A few
little boys were playing hide-and-seek, and now and then
a nurse passed, wheeling a perambulator. An old pensioner,
sucking an empty pipe, hobbled up to the seat I
had taken a corner of, though all the others were vacant,
and began with much fumbling to unfold a greasy-looking
newspaper. The sight of his futile senility somehow irritated
me, and I stared at him fiercely, but he sat on. I
began to think that perhaps Owen would not come: for
all I knew he might be away from home. Two or three
untidy, vulgar, little girls, with smaller brothers and sisters
in tow, came up to inquire “the right time.” After I had
satisfied their curiosity they still hovered near me, gazing
at me in a silence that it was difficult to construe as flattering.
At a distance of three or four yards they then settled
down stolidly to some obscure game, in which a great deal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289"></a>[289]</span>
of monotonous, rhymed dialogue was the principal feature.
They intoned this in shrill, unmodulated voices, but all the
time keeping a sharp look-out on my movements. The old
pensioner turned his watery eyes on me and made a remark
about the weather. I pretended not to hear him, but he
only made it again, and I had to answer. He began to talk
politics. His fumbling hands, his foolish, empty pipe, his
bleared and rheumy eyes, depressed me, and I wondered why
he couldn’t be put into a lethal chamber. Then I saw
Owen turn the corner and sprang up to meet him.</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you come to the house? Where are your
things?” he asked. The little girls had suspended their
game to watch us with breathless interest.</p>

<p>“I’m not going to stay, Owen. I came up just because
I wanted to speak to you about something—— Get away!”
This last remark was addressed to a child who had drawn
nearer, so as not to miss what we were saying. She stared
at me with an expression of solemn idiocy, but without
budging an inch from the position she had taken up.</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” said Owen, “but of course you’ll
stay now you’re here. I can lend you everything you need,
and I’ve told them at home to expect you.”</p>

<p>“I can’t. My father would hardly let me come; even
as it was.”</p>

<p>“Get yer hair cut,” suggested the polite child, putting
out her tongue.</p>

<p>“Owen, I want to tell you something: I want your
advice.”</p>

<p>He at once became serious. He took my arm and we
strolled down toward the pond, followed by the whole band
of children, who, captained by the same odious little girl,
screamed now in chorus, “Get yer hair cut! Get yer hair
cut!”</p>

<p>The din they made was terrific. I waited till we had
turned the corner and were out of sight of the gardeners
and the pensioner. Then I swung round quickly and made<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290"></a>[290]</span>
a grab at the ringleader. In about two seconds, kicking
and screaming, she was across my knee, and I was administering
as sound a spanking as she had ever received in her
life.</p>

<p>“I say,” cried Owen, “what on earth are you doing?”</p>

<p>I released my captive, who with crimson, tear-drenched
face, and open mouth, went bawling back in the direction
she had come from.</p>

<p>“That’s all right, any way,” I said to the astonished
Owen. “There’s nothing like taking these things in
time.”</p>

<p>The rest of the children had retreated, moving backwards,
with round eyes fixed on me, but perfectly callous
to the woes of their comrade.</p>

<p>“You’ll be having someone coming and kicking up the
mischief of a row,” said Owen, uneasily.</p>

<p>“I don’t care. Can’t we find a quiet place?”</p>

<p>Owen considered. “Come down the Lagan walk: there’s
never anybody there.”</p>

<p>I let him take me, and we walked till we were stopped by
a low parapet, over which we had a charming view of the
black mud-banks of the river, for the tide was out, and
beyond this a strip of waste land, dotted with mill chimneys
and the backs of dirty houses. It was neither a cheerful
nor a beautiful outlook, but we both stood gazing over the
wall, as if beyond it lay the New Jerusalem.</p>

<p>“It’s horribly smelly,” I discovered at length.</p>

<p>“I thought you wanted somewhere quiet,” Owen
apologized.</p>

<p>“I didn’t mean this sort of thing. I’m sure there’s a
dead cat or dog in that sack down there. Come away.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know the tide was out,” said Owen patiently.</p>

<p>But I found it difficult now to begin my story. Those
wretched children had upset everything. I was quite
unreasonably cross, too, with Owen, for bringing me to these
hideous mud-banks, with their litter of old boots, of empty<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291"></a>[291]</span>
tins and broken bottles. I even had it on the tip of my
tongue to tell him it was just like him, but refrained.</p>

<p>We retraced our steps and found a seat near the pond.
Here we sat in silence, Owen waiting for me to begin my
tale.</p>

<p>“Something very unpleasant happened yesterday,” I
murmured, branching off to a secondary subject.</p>

<p>“Happened to you?”</p>

<p>“Not to me only—— It was a letter my father got from
Uncle George—the people I was living with in town here,
you know.”</p>

<p>“I know.”</p>

<p>“You remember the chap who came with us to
‘Faust?’”</p>

<p>“Your cousin?”</p>

<p>I nodded. “He had some photographs which he kept
hidden under the floor in our bedroom.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“So that nobody would get hold of them. They were—that
kind. I don’t know where he got them from.”</p>

<p>“Bad?”</p>

<p>I nodded again. “And they were found a few days ago,
and he denied that they were his, so Uncle George wrote
to my father.”</p>

<p>“Saying they must be yours?”</p>

<p>“It came to that, though he didn’t actually say it.”</p>

<p>“But you denied it too?”</p>

<p>“Yes—only—I don’t know that my father believes me.”</p>

<p>“Even now?”</p>

<p>“He says he does, but I’m not sure. At any rate it has
upset him a lot.”</p>

<p>“He must be an awfully low cad.”</p>

<p>“George? He’s not up to much. But I expect it
never occurred to him that his people would write, and I
suppose he thought, now I was out of the way, it wouldn’t
much matter to me whether they blamed me or not.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292"></a>[292]</span>
Neither would it have mattered, if Uncle George hadn’t
written.”</p>

<p>“Of course it would have. What is your father going to
do?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. There is nothing he <em>can</em> do, except tell
them what I say.” I felt suddenly sad and doubtful—doubtful
of the quality of my own innocence, which had
seemed perfectly clear before. “I’m not sure that I’m
giving you a right impression,” I went on, after a short
silence. “I knew George had these things: I had looked
at them: I knew where he kept them.”</p>

<p>“It all seems to me very rotten,” said Owen, disgustedly.</p>

<p>“It is, rather. Aunt Margaret may write to Mrs. Carroll,
for instance, just out of spite.”</p>

<p>“She can hardly do that now.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. She hates me. And it would be horrible
if she did, though Mrs. Carroll wouldn’t believe her.”</p>

<p>I was silent a while. “But that isn’t really what I came
up to tell you,” I suddenly began. Then I related what had
happened yesterday in the wood.</p>

<p>Owen stared in front of him at the drab, seedy-looking,
little ducks, who were paddling about on the dirty sheet of
water. A rat stole out, and seeing us scuttled back again.</p>

<p>“Why did you behave like that? It was most extraordinary!”</p>

<p>I made no answer.</p>

<p>“It wasn’t very gentlemanly, you know,” Owen continued,
“to say the least of it.”</p>

<p>“I never said I was a gentleman,” I interrupted. “I’m
not one, in the ordinary sense of the word, nor even in the
other, according to you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s rot.” He sat trying to puzzle it out. He
looked at me and unexpectedly smiled.</p>

<p>I smiled too, but my heart was heavy as lead. “Well,
that’s all I came up to tell you,” I muttered, “—not very
much!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293"></a>[293]</span></p>

<p>He saw I was not happy. “I know I’m not very experienced
in matters of this kind,” he confessed, “but if I were
you, Peter, I should go to Derryaghy and ask to see her.
Would you like me to do anything?”</p>

<p>“There’s nothing you could do. Would it not be better
for me to write?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think so. It might be easier.”</p>

<p>“It would be. And suppose she won’t see me?”</p>

<p>“You can only try.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll go back and think it over.”</p>

<p>“But won’t you stay, really?”</p>

<p>“No. I must go.”</p>

<p>“Before this happened she liked you very much—she
told me so herself.”</p>

<p>I shook my head. “It is all over. She will never speak
to me again.”</p>

<p>“If she doesn’t——” He stopped.</p>

<p>“What?” I asked.</p>

<p>“She isn’t worth bothering about,” Owen concluded.</p>

<p>“Oh, you don’t know.”</p>

<p>“What was there, after all, so very dreadful? It’s not
as if you were in any way repulsive!”</p>

<p>He tried to persuade me to change my mind about going
home as we walked toward the park gate, but I was firm.
“Good-bye, Owen,” I said. “Thank you for coming. I
will write to you if there is anything to write about.”</p>

<p>I got on a tram, and he stood on the footpath, looking
after me.</p>

<p>Owen had cheered me up a little; I was glad I had come;
and during my return journey I pondered the advice he
had given me and decided that I must follow it. I waited
till nine o’clock, by which hour I thought Gerald would
probably have gone out, for I wanted to avoid him: then I
went up to Derryaghy. So far as I could see, the only way
was to call just as usual, and trust to luck to get a few
minutes with Katherine alone.</p>

<p>But at the door my courage failed me, and I stepped
softly round to the terrace, and, standing hidden in the
deep shadow of the house, looked to see who was in the
room. The curtain was as usual undrawn and the room
was full of lamplight. They were all there. Gerald was
sprawling on his back on the sofa; Katherine was working
at her table-cloth, her head bent over it so that I could not
see her face; Miss Dick was writing; Mrs. Carroll was
playing “Patience.” Presently Katherine looked up, and,
for a moment or two, before she returned to her work, I saw
her gaze out into the darkness. The others, except Mrs.
Carroll, had their backs to me; a small fire was burning in
the grate. I stood there under a kind of fascination. The
impression was strange, and even slightly weird. Looking
in upon them, all so silent and so unconscious of my presence,
I had a peculiar feeling that, if I came right into their
line of vision, they would still not see me. I had a strange
feeling that I was actually invisible, and, moreover, that I
was not the only watcher there, and, that if we were invisible
to the inmates of the room, we might not be invisible
to each other. Other faces, pale and dim, peered in at other
windows; the house was surrounded by shadowy presences—shadowy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295"></a>[295]</span>
forms that hovered outside here on the terrace,
that glided up and down the wide, dark, creaking staircase,
or stood motionless in the upper rooms. I stepped back and
looked up at the long line of black, unlit windows, with just
here and there a glimmering light. And I felt as if I no
longer belonged to the same world as the occupants of
the room I watched. I was but a memory, a ghost; my
place was upstairs; in dim passages; by trembling blinds,
pulled aside for just a moment that we might peep out; in
shadowy rooms; behind doors whose handles the timid
maid, hurrying by in her glimmer of unsteady candlelight,
feared to turn. I was the breath that set the curtains at
the bed’s head trembling; the faint sound as of a chair
pushed back on the upper floor; the draught—was it a
draught?—that made the lamp-flame flicker; the pale
reflection passing across the looking-glass and gone before
there was time to strike a match. I was that mysterious
something one turned one’s head quickly to see, and did not
see; the cold touch that awakened just before dawn; the
gray, ghostly figure sitting by the window in the first wan
light, and that was no longer there when one rubbed one’s
eyes; the tapping on the window-pane as of a leaf—the
tapping that must surely be only a leaf moved by the wind.</p>

<p>I do not know how long I stood there: it may have been
but a few minutes, yet it was long enough for me to realize
that the simple act of entering the room was become an
impossibility. It would have required too violent an effort,
too sharp and brutal a wrench, an effort I shrank from as
from physical pain. I must write to Katherine. How
could I go in there as if nothing had happened? If she came
out on to the terrace I might find courage to speak to her,
but she would not come. Gerald, on the other hand, almost
certainly would; and if he discovered me prowling about
like this what would he think? I slipped away, then, like a
veritable ghost, my footsteps making no noise upon the
faded grass.</p>

<p>I wrote that night to Katherine, but she did not reply to
my letter, and I had no heart to send a second. Two days
passed, during which I did not go near Derryaghy, but took
to gardening, and when Gerald came down on the second
afternoon I offered this as my excuse for not going with him.
The fact was that I felt uncomfortable in his society, not
knowing how much he knew. He had witnessed my discomfiture
on the night Katherine had cut me, and of
course he must have questioned her afterwards.</p>

<p>During these days I made one or two attempts to come to
a more cordial relation with my father; yet it seemed to me
that he suspected the genuineness of my timid advances,
and at all events his unresponsiveness discouraged me from
repeating them.</p>

<p>On the evening of the third day, having nothing else to
do, I strolled listlessly in the direction of the field occupied
by the booths of the steam-circus proprietors. It was
recognizable from afar by a luminous cloud that hung above
it like a curtain of fire against the night. The wind was
blowing from that direction, and, as I advanced, my ears
were filled with the rough music blared out by a couple of
steam-organs, a music broken every now and again by
short convulsive shrieks as of demoniac laughter. Swings,
shooting-galleries, throwing-competitions—all were in the
full energy of life when I approached; but the chief centres
of attraction were the two hobby-horse machines, brightly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297"></a>[297]</span>
painted and flashing with mirrors and gilding. I mingled in
the outer ring of spectators about the larger of these two
wheeling monsters, and stood gazing at it, as it turned round
swiftly and rhythmically to the throbbing din of brazen
pipes. White puffs of steam shot up against the black sky
in the coloured glare of naphtha lamps. Girls with flushed,
excited faces, tossed hair and shining eyes, leaned sideways
from the horses’ backs, laughed, swayed in a kind of innocent
abandon toward their accompanying sweethearts. Arms
were round waists, the pops of guns mingled with the blare
of the music, the shrieks of the steam-whistle, the shrillness
of feminine voices. Standing there, in lonely contemplation
of all this Dionysian revelry, I felt as hopelessly out of touch
with it, as if I had wandered thither from another planet.
Suddenly I felt a hand laid lightly on my arm, and looking
round saw the laughing face of Annie Breen.</p>

<p>She asked me if I had seen their Willie, but without
waiting for an answer went on to chatter about all the people
who were here to-night. A whole crowd had come over
from Castlewellan; and there were a lot of excursionists
from Belfast, who had missed the last train, and nobody
knew where they were going to sleep, for there wasn’t a
room to be had in the hotels. Wasn’t it fun? They
would have to stay out all night; and if it rained wouldn’t
it be awful?</p>

<p>“There’s room for two there,” she cried, “those white
horses. Ellen Gibson and Brian Seery are getting off.”</p>

<p>I made a half-hearted movement forward, but in my lack
of enthusiasm was ousted by a more eager couple whose eyes
had been as quick as Annie’s. There was no hint of reproach,
however, in the smile the girl turned on me.</p>

<p>“We’ll get them next time, and I’d just as soon watch,
any way. Wouldn’t you?”</p>

<p>“There’s Willie over there,” I suggested. “Perhaps you
would like——”</p>

<p>But she interrupted me. “I don’t care about the horses.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298"></a>[298]</span>
Only maybe I’m keeping you: maybe you’re waiting for
somebody?”</p>

<p>“No,” I answered, hurriedly.</p>

<p>“Let’s go round the tents then. Will you?”</p>

<p>We moved over to the one which appeared to have attracted
the largest crowd. In the foreground, just beyond
the barrier, was a long counter or table covered with cheap
ornaments, artificial jewelry, and boxes of unhealthy-looking
cigars; and behind this, set in tiers against the canvas back
of the tent itself, were three rows of grotesque, painted,
wooden busts, waiting to be knocked down. Surrounded
by a group of encouraging spectators, George Edge was
stolidly bombarding these figures with a good deal of success,
though what he intended to do with his prizes it was difficult
to imagine. We stood and watched him, and every now
and again a loud smack was instantly followed by the disappearance
of one of the dolls.</p>

<p>“Have a throw you,” said Annie. “Go on. I’m sure
you can do it better than him.”</p>

<p>An obliging lady handed me three wooden balls, about
the size of tennis balls, in exchange for two pence; but in
absence of mind I came within an ace of sending the first
of these at the head of the proprietor himself, which just
then bobbed up close to the dolls, and in features, colouring,
and expression, startlingly resembled them. At my third
shot I was successful, and Annie chose a gold and turquoise
cross. We passed on to the next booth, leaving George still
pegging away, with a perseverance that must have cost him
about half-a-crown already. Annie herself now won a
walking-stick, by throwing a wooden ring over it, and this
trophy was presented to me.</p>

<p>“Let’s get out of the glare for a minute,” she said unexpectedly.
“It’s that hot with all the lights and things I
can’t hardly breathe.”</p>

<p>We passed behind the tents, and a few steps brought us
into shadow, and a few steps more to a bank under a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299"></a>[299]</span>
hawthorn-hedge, where we sat down. I had nothing to say to
her, and, as it did not seem to matter to Annie whether we
talked or not, I pursued my own thoughts. She leaned up
against me confidingly, but I was hardly more conscious of
her presence than of the bank upon which I sat. I was
thinking, and presently I put a question to her, put it perfectly
seriously. “Suppose, Annie,” I began very deliberately,—“suppose
you were friends with somebody—somebody
like me, say. Suppose you knew he was very fond of
you, and, one day, when you were alone together, without
asking you if he might, he put his arms round you and
kissed you—would you be very angry with him, so angry
that you would never speak to him nor look at him again?”</p>

<p>I kept my eyes fixed upon the ground as I awaited her
reply, and I awaited it with some anxiety. It seemed to me a
long while coming. All at once I felt two warm lips pressed
against my cheek. I was so taken aback by the unexpected
nature of this answer that I’m afraid I drew away from it.
I understood that poor Annie had seen in my question
only a somewhat timid method of courtship. It was
distinctly awkward. She leaned her head sentimentally on
my shoulder, and we sat in this absurd position for several
minutes, while I had time to reflect on the hopeless inconsistency
of feminine nature. As soon as I could, without
hurting her feelings, I got up. “We must try the hobby-horses
now,” I said, with feeble sprightliness, seizing on the
only pretext I could think of to escape from a disagreeable
situation.</p>

<p>Annie rose too, but with no great alacrity: in fact, she
remarked that she was sick of the hobby-horses. I pretended
not to believe her. We went back to the spot where
she had first spoken to me, and, when the machine came to
a standstill, secured two riderless steeds. Mine was on the
outside and Annie’s of course next to it, but we were no
sooner in possession of them than I became aware of Katherine
and Gerald among the spectators quite close to us. I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300"></a>[300]</span>
looked the other way, and I felt my face grow crimson. It
seemed to me that the engine-man would never set us in
motion. Already we appeared to have been waiting for
an eternity. Annie was laughing and chattering, and I
answered at random, though, indeed, to the kind of remarks
she was making, any sort of answer served. Had she, too,
seen the Dales? for her vivacity had suddenly become much
more noisy and familiar, with something about it that
smacked rather of town than of country? I noticed that
all the other riders were obviously in couples, and that most
of the youths were supporting their partners in a strikingly
gallant fashion. Annie had already given me permission to
follow their example by telling me half a dozen times she
was sure she’d fall off. I didn’t care very much whether she
did or not. At last, with a shrill and frivolous scream, the
huge construction began to revolve slowly, and our horses
to move up and down on their polished brass rods. We
swept by within a yard or two of Katherine and Gerald,
but I looked straight before me, my face burning. I
would have liked to pretend that I was there for a solitary
ride, quite independent of Annie, but her manner made any
such hypocrisy perfectly futile. Round we came a second
time, and a third, gathering velocity at every moment. Annie
had taken off her hat and put it on my horse’s head, and her
skirts streamed out behind, and flapped against my right
leg.</p>

<p>“Peter!”</p>

<p>It was Katherine’s voice. She had called my name. It
came to me through the night, and an indescribable emotion
shook me. I could not have spoken: my eyes were blinded
with tears: and again the huge machine swept round. But
in the place where Katherine and Gerald had been I could
no longer see them. Where were they gone? The organ
belched its coarse music, the steam throbbed, the whistle
hooted, we rushed on faster and faster. Where were they?
She had called me. Perhaps they had gone home. I could<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301"></a>[301]</span>
not wait any longer, but slipped from my horse’s back.
Annie screamed; the man who was going round collecting the
fares while the ride was in progress made a grab at me; but
I jumped—jumped and fell headlong, rolling over and
knocking all the breath out of my body, though luckily not
breaking any bones. Instantly there was commotion.
A crowd gathered about me, and everybody seemed to think
I had either gone mad or been seized with a fit. I scrambled
to my feet as soon as I had pumped a little wind into myself,
and, without waiting to brush the dust from my clothes,
without answering any of the questions that poured in upon
me from all sides, pushed my way through the people, who
appeared inclined to detain me by force, and hurried, as fast
as my still rather breathless condition would allow, in pursuit
of Katherine and Gerald. Alas, I could see no sign of
them. They had vanished as completely and mysteriously
as Persephone on that summer morning in the meadows. I
clambered through the hedge out on to the road, but there
was no one there. I ran on till I reached the turning, but
there was no one there either, and I knew I had missed them,
for the road here lay straight and bare in both directions.
I stood still by the sea-wall. I could not go back. The
glare and din were now become impossible, to say
nothing of Annie, whom I had flouted in so unscrupulous a
fashion.</p>

<p>I took my old path over the golf-links till I reached the
hollow where I always came when I wanted to be quite alone.
I flung myself down on the soft, white, powdery sand, among
the thin gray grasses, in the pallid starlight. My heart was
surging with emotions, at once happy and desolating. I
could not understand what had occurred; only I heard
again and again the sound of my name, as it had come to me
in that loved voice through the night.</p>

<p>I lay there for a long time. I was crying, I think, but I
did not know I was crying, though I kept wiping my tears
away. I was unconscious of everything around me, I was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302"></a>[302]</span>
blind and deaf, and it was only when I felt a hand on my
shoulder that I looked up, startled, and saw Katherine
bending over me.</p>

<p>“Peter, what is the matter? Is it my fault?”</p>

<p>Her voice was all gentleness; in her face a beautiful
tenderness; but I could not speak.</p>

<p>“It is nothing,” I stammered out at last. “Only I
thought—you were never going to speak to me again, and—”</p>

<p>“I was horrid. I can’t think now why I was so horrid.
Forget about it, Peter dear, won’t you? Tell me you
will.”</p>

<p>“It was my fault,” I muttered. “It was all my fault.”</p>

<p>“Never mind whose fault it was. Let us forget about it.”</p>

<p>“I can’t forget,” I said. “It was my fault.”</p>

<p>“But why—when I want you to? Can’t you forget,
even if you know I love you?”</p>

<p>I scrambled to my feet and stood facing her. “Do you
really?” I faltered. “Don’t say it if—if it is not true.”</p>

<p>“It is true.”</p>

<p>“How is it true?” I asked. “How much? Do you
love me as much as you love Gerald?”</p>

<p>She hesitated, and it seemed to me that it was because she
feared to wound me. “Yes,” she said at last, in a low voice.
There was something that touched me, through all my longing
and pain, in her desire to be perfectly honest. “Better
than Gerald. Better than anybody,” she pursued, doubtfully,
“better than anybody, I think, except mother.”</p>

<p>I sighed; I could not help it.</p>

<p>She looked at me sadly. “Why aren’t you content,
Peter? Why do you always want more than I can give,
when I have given you so much?”</p>

<p>“And Owen?” I asked, though I was ashamed of myself
for doing so.</p>

<p>“I like Owen very much. I think he is very nice, but
that is all. And now tell me you are content. I must
go, and I shan’t be happy unless I know <em>you</em> are.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303"></a>[303]</span></p>

<p>“I am happy,” I lied most dismally. I saw indeed that
it was all hopeless, and that she would never understand.</p>

<p>“I will see you to-morrow. I can’t stay now; Gerald
is waiting for me over at the Club House.”</p>

<p>“Where were you when I looked for you?” I asked. “I
heard you call my name, and I jumped off, but when I went
to look for you, you were gone.”</p>

<p>“Miss Dick was with us, and she wanted to go home; but
we went round the other way—not by the sea. We had to
go all the way back with Miss Dick, but I got Gerald to come
out again, for I thought, I don’t know why, I might find
you here. And I’m very glad I came. I couldn’t go on
any longer without making it up. But I mustn’t really
wait now. I told Gerald I should only be five minutes.
Good-night, Peter. Come to-morrow morning.”</p>

<p>“Good-night.”</p>

<p>She was gone, and I was left alone to whatever felicity I
might be able to discover.</p>

<p>Of the days that followed our reconciliation I tried to make
the most. Too much time already had been wasted and
spoiled by clouds of jealousy and other troubles. I knew
the kind of love Katherine offered me was very different
from the kind of love I had desired, and in the old days
dreamed of, but more than this I did not know, and some
instinct kept me from trying to find out. We had become
again such friends as we had been last year, and I lent myself
to a certain protective quality in her affection for me,
because I felt that it was in this way she could care for me
most. From her point of view I knew that if I could have
dropped back two or three years nearer to my childhood it
would really have been preferable. She would have liked
to pet me and tell me stories.</p>

<p>What her brother thought of our quarrel, and of our
making up again, I never heard. He gave no sign of having
noticed anything. I had ceased, indeed, to see very much of
him, for he had taken to knocking about the Club House and
the hotel more and more. This left Katherine and me almost
wholly to each other’s company. I saw her each morning,
afternoon, and evening, and I moved through day after day
in a kind of dream, as if this ideal life were to last for ever.</p>

<p>One afternoon I went up to Derryaghy as usual, but the
servant who answered the door told me Mrs. Carroll wished
to see me, and when I was shown into the morning-room I
found her there alone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305"></a>[305]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, I wanted to speak to you, Peter,” she said. “Katherine
is out with her mother, who arrived an hour ago.
They went out after lunch.”</p>

<p>I stared my surprise. “I didn’t know she was coming!” I
murmured.</p>

<p>“Neither did anybody else. She didn’t even send a
telegram.”</p>

<p>From her tone I gathered that Mrs. Carroll was not altogether
pleased by this unexpected visit. “What has she
come <em>for</em>?” I asked.</p>

<p>“That’s just what I want you to tell me. The woman is
raging with me, and now we’re alone we’d better have the
whole matter out.”</p>

<p>“But what matter?” I inquired innocently. “What
have <em>I</em> to do with it?”</p>

<p>“Goodness knows! Sit down, child; I want to talk to
you seriously.... Miss Dick said something to me more
than once, but Miss Dick is a perfect fool when it comes to
questions of this kind, and I paid no attention to her.”
She looked at me. “Don’t you understand? It is about
Katherine—about you and Katherine. Mrs. Dale’s visit
is the result of some letter which Katherine sent to her, and
which I haven’t seen. How was I to imagine such things?
I had always looked upon you as children, and now she
arrives, simply furious, and accuses me of not looking after
her daughter.”</p>

<p>I had begun to blush.</p>

<p>“Tell me exactly how much there is in it all?” Mrs.
Carroll continued. “You are the only person who appears
to have any common-sense.”</p>

<p>“What does she say?” I asked ingenuously.</p>

<p>“She says— Oh! what doesn’t she say? She says she’s
going to take Katherine home with her to-morrow, and that
she thought she should have been able to trust me!”</p>

<p>I looked at her helplessly, but made no reply.</p>

<p>“I knew you liked Katherine,” Mrs. Carroll went on,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306"></a>[306]</span>
“but it never occurred to me there was any particular
reason why you shouldn’t like her—nor, indeed, do I see any
now. They didn’t expect, I suppose, that she was going to
spend all her time with a couple of old women like me and
Miss Dick!” She paused. “You <em>are</em> very fond of her,
aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I replied, as if I were repeating my catechism.</p>

<p>“And apparently she is fond of you.”</p>

<p>I shook my head. Then, as she looked at me interrogatively,
“Not like that—not in the same way,” I murmured.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carroll continued to regard me. “Not like what?
What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“She doesn’t even understand,” I pursued.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carroll’s face altered, grew graver, though not less
kind. “Then there <em>is</em> something in it? You really care—very
much?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“But——” her perplexity seemed to increase.</p>

<p>I waited, twirling my straw-hat on my knee, and only now
and then glancing up. She eyed me thoughtfully. “You
know it is all quite impossible,” she brought out slowly.
“And you’re so ridiculously young!” For a moment she
smiled. Then she put her hand sympathetically upon mine,
which rested on the arm of my chair. Yet I could see she
still more or less regarded the affair in the light of a sentimental
fancy that would dissolve as quickly as dew under
the sun.</p>

<p>I got up. “I think I’ll go now,” I said, plucking at the
ribbon of my hat.</p>

<p>“I’ll not keep you, Peter, if you want to go. Remember,
I’m not scolding you, or angry with you in any way,” she
added. “As I told you, I see no reason why you shouldn’t
be fond of Katherine. I can perfectly trust you. It is just
that you are a boy, and of course such things can come to
nothing so far as you are concerned; whereas, in Katherine’s
case, and especially since she is a year older than you, it is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307"></a>[307]</span>
quite different. Her mother probably has her eye on a husband
for her already. That, I am afraid, is the secret of all
this indignation. However, I’ve taken your part. I told
her exactly what you are—that you are a gentleman, and
would never do anything dishonourable; that a word would
be enough; and that it was perfectly ridiculous to talk of
taking Katherine home before the natural end of her visit,
which will be on Friday or Saturday of this week. If she
<em>does</em> take her, not one of them shall ever enter this house
again. That, at least, is certain. I’m not going to have any
nonsense about it. Will you dine here to-night?”</p>

<p>I shook my head.</p>

<p>“Where are you going now?”</p>

<p>“Out into the woods just.”</p>

<p>She kissed me. “Well, whatever happens, I’ll promise
that Katherine shan’t go without saying good-bye to you.
Be a good boy, and come to see me to-morrow.”</p>

<p>When I left Mrs. Carroll I did not go out at once, but
scribbled first a note to Katherine, telling her I had gone to
the summer-house, and should wait for her there all afternoon.
I then went in search of Jim, who had always been
my friend, and whom I could rely upon absolutely. I found
him working with Thomas in the greenhouses, and, as soon
as I could attract his attention, I beckoned him outside. He
was a very different Jim from the one who had climbed a
ladder to see my skin peeling off, though he had the same
round rosy candid face, like a ripe russet apple, and though
he still played doleful tunes on his flute. But he had
developed amazingly: he had grown into a strapping big
fellow, with limbs like a youthful Hercules. When I explained
to him that I wanted him to give a note to Miss
Dale, but that nobody must see him do it, he promised to
try his best.</p>

<p>I went on to the summer-house and lay down among the
bracken close by. I had been there fully two hours before
I saw Katherine coming. She smiled brightly as I rose
from my ferny bed to greet her.</p>

<p>“Why did I come without an umbrella?” she exclaimed
gaily. “It’s just going to pour!” And she turned to look
at the heavy clouds that were gliding up rapidly against the
wind.</p>

<p>“You can shelter in the summer-house,” I said, laconically.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_309"></a>[309]</span></p>

<p>“I loathe summer-houses, especially when they’re like
this old thing, crammed with earwigs and spiders.”</p>

<p>“The rain is going to be heavy: you’d better come in
now,” I went on, without attempting to emulate her lightness
of manner. I dusted the rough seat for her with my
pocket-handkerchief, in silence, just as the first big drops
came pattering down on the leaves.</p>

<p>She sat down, and I stood near the door, looking at her.
“Mrs. Carroll told me your mother arrived to-day, because
of some letter of yours about me.”</p>

<p>Katherine coloured a little. “I know,” she answered,
eagerly. “It’s awfully silly of mamma. I’ve been talking
to her about it.”</p>

<p>“And you are to go home at once—to-morrow—perhaps
this evening.”</p>

<p>She laughed. “Certainly not this evening. How could
we? And at any rate, we should have been going in a few
days. But I told mamma she was taking it all absurdly
seriously, and behaving exactly like a furious parent in a
novel.”</p>

<p>“It is serious to me,” I said, quietly, “though to you it
may be amusing.” That she should laugh in this way hurt
me deeply.</p>

<p>It had grown rapidly dark, and now a heavy rain began,
cold and sad, sweeping through the trees, very soon making it
plain that the summer-house was in need of repair. From
the distance there came the crying of a sea-gull, a mournful,
solitary note.</p>

<p>“Don’t be angry with me, Peter,” said Katherine, coming
to the door and looking out. “I know it was stupid of me
to write, but I never dreamt of mamma coming over like
this.... Why has it got so dark?”</p>

<p>Before I could answer there came a blinding flash of
lightning, accompanied, nearly instantaneously, by a
hideous din of thunder, which seemed to burst out
just over us. A blank silence succeeded this ear-splitting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310"></a>[310]</span>
crash, and Katherine said, “Some tree must have
gone!”</p>

<p>“I wish it had been this summer-house,” I muttered
bitterly.</p>

<p>She looked at me, her face grown graver. The flash was
followed by no other, but the rain continued in a fierce
downpour, beating through our flimsy shelter, and streaming
down the paths in brown muddy rivulets.</p>

<p>“I can’t understand why mamma should have made such
a fuss,” Katherine went on, but no longer in the same tone,
though I knew well enough the alteration in it was due
merely to what I had said. “She is usually very
sensible.”</p>

<p>“How can you be so indifferent?” I asked, in a rough
voice, for her calmness exasperated me.</p>

<p>“I’m not indifferent. I’m sorry I wrote. But we should
have been going in three or four days, at any rate. You
know that.” Her manner was tinged with a faint reproach.</p>

<p>I answered nothing, and she went on. “It is getting
lighter—the rain will soon be over.”</p>

<p>“Do you want to go?” I asked furiously. “Don’t let
me keep you if you do!”</p>

<p>“Why do you speak like that, Peter? I told you I was
sorry.”</p>

<p>“This is the last time I shall see you alone.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense.”</p>

<p>“If you are going to-morrow, will you promise to meet
me to-night somewhere—here—or on the golf-links?”</p>

<p>“I can’t possibly. There are people coming to dinner.
Won’t <em>you</em> come—or come in afterwards, at least?”</p>

<p>“Shall I see you by yourself if I do?”</p>

<p>“By myself?”</p>

<p>“Will you come out here with me?”</p>

<p>She sighed at my unreasonableness. “How can I?

can I leave them? But say you’ll come.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_311"></a>[311]</span></p>

<p>“I certainly won’t,” I answered sullenly. “What does
it matter to you whether I do or not?”</p>

<p>I felt her lips touch my cheek. Her face was wet and
cold with the rain. I put my arms round her very gently,
and kissed her hair and her cheek, but no more than that,
for I knew her own embrace had been given merely to console
me, and because it was for the last time. Her dark eyes
caressed me, and she smiled a little. She laid her hand on
my shoulder. “Will you walk back to the house with me
now, Peter? You are not angry with me?”</p>

<p>“No,” I answered.</p>

<p>“I can’t stay any longer, because mamma knows I came
out, and she will suspect it was to meet you. She is not so
bad about it as she was when she first arrived. I managed
to convince her that she had been alarming herself unnecessarily.”</p>

<p>“Very unnecessarily,” I thought, but I said nothing.</p>

<p>I walked back with her, and then on down the drive and
home.</p>

<p>I was writing to Owen when my father brought me Katherine’s
letter. It was to say good-bye to me, and there was a
veiled reproach at my not having come to the station to see
them off. She had looked out for me up to the last
moment; so that in the end it was really I who had failed!
I smiled dimly.</p>

<p>As I write it now, in this quiet, gray, autumn morning,
it appears to me that the thought then hovering at the back
of my mind was, after all, not so very foolish. Death, coming
without disease, without weakness, before life has grown
stale, before illusions have been shattered and innocence
marred;—simply upon the bright, fresh comedy of life, the
dropping of a dark, rapid curtain.</p>

<p>I finished my letter to Owen, and addressed it; but when
that was done I still sat on at the table, holding my pen, on
which the ink had long since dried. Then I bent down and
leaned my forehead upon Katherine’s open letter. When
I looked up the sun was shining in the garden, and shining
in on me through the window; nothing had changed....</p>

<p>In the afternoon I went up to Derryaghy, where Mrs. Carroll
received me. I spoke quite quietly to her, just as usual;
but all I remember now is that there were some red dahlias
in a bowl on the table, and that Mrs. Carroll proposed taking
me to Paris for my Christmas holidays.</p>

<p>It was when I had left her and had gone out to walk in
the woods, that I suddenly felt the full reality of what had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_313"></a>[313]</span>
happened. It meant that everything was finished, that I
should never see Katherine again. I was filled with
desolation, with a kind of sick feeling that my love had
been superfluous, wasted, and perhaps distasteful. Last
year I had been sorry to say good-bye to her; I had dreaded
the new life opening out before me; but I had had the
prospect of meeting her again at a year’s end, and the belief
that she cared for me and would remember me. Now there
was nothing—nothing.</p>

<p>My grief was mingled with a kind of bitter, impotent rage
against I knew not what. I kicked a stick that lay in my
path savagely out of the way, cursing it under my breath.
I flung myself down among the bracken. Sometimes a
kind of blank would come into my mind, and I would find
myself staring stupidly at the trees, while for a few moments
an altogether different thought would slip into my brain;
then my grief would overwhelm me once more, and blot out
the world.</p>

<p>But was this grief I felt? I do not know. It was
different from what I felt later. It was something violent
and maddening, sweeping over me in paroxysms, leaving me
intervals of cold insensibility. And late that night, when,
thoroughly wearied out, I went to bed, and from sheer
exhaustion would be dropping off to sleep, from time to time
it would pierce through my numbing senses, and waken
me sharply, as if some one had violently pulled me, so that
I would start up, yet for a moment not realize what it was
that had wakened me.</p>

<p>I did not go back to Derryaghy on the next day or the
next. I took long walks, and it was during these solitary
rambles that the thought of death came irresistibly to me.
I felt that my life was become an intolerable burden, and
in my inexperience I imagined that the pain I felt now I
should feel always. I thought of shooting myself, of taking
poison, only I disliked the idea of other people knowing.
Was there not a better way? I thought of swimming out so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_314"></a>[314]</span>
far that it would be impossible to return, but I dreaded the
pain of suffocation. Then, two days before my time for
leaving home, and when Owen had written saying that
they expected me and that he would be at the station to meet
me, there came a night of wind and rain, and it seemed to
me I had found the solution to my problem.</p>

<p>Shortly before midnight, when my father’s snores had
become deep and regular, I stole out of the house, as I had so
often done in the old days of our club. I had put on my
overcoat, but under it I wore only my night-shirt, and I
hurried down the road and across the golf-links in the cold,
driving rain. When I reached an exposed spot, I took off
my coat and lay down on the soaking ground, letting the
wind and rain sweep over me. I lay there till morning.
It did not matter if I were seen returning to the house then;
it would simply be thought that I had gone out for an early
bathe. As I staggered to my feet my limbs were so stiff
and cramped that at first I could hardly hobble along, but
after I had gone a little way it became easier.</p>

<p>I got into bed in my wet night-shirt, but I could not go
to sleep. My head ached and I was shivering; yet a few
minutes later I no longer felt cold; on the contrary, a burning
heat seemed like a fire under my skin. I could not lie
for two minutes without altering my position; and when I
got up to dress I knew I was really ill. At breakfast I only
pretended to eat. My father noticed there was something
the matter and questioned me, when I answered that I was
all right, and presently he left me to go to the school, which
was being whitewashed and made ready for the re-opening
next week. As for me, I was glad I should not have to repeat
my experiment twice, and I had even a naïve curiosity
as to the precise nature of my illness.</p>

<p>Before night I began to feel much worse. My father went
out to a meeting in connection with church matters, and I
was left alone. I should have gone to bed, had not the task
of climbing two flights of stairs and undressing appeared<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_315"></a>[315]</span>
almost insurmountable; so I half sat, half lay, in a chair,
with my eyes shut and my head leaning back. I was extremely
thirsty, and at every breath I drew my side hurt
me, the pain being increased by the fact that I had begun
to cough a little. It had all come on so quickly that I
wondered if I should die that night.</p>

<p>When my father came in he immediately saw I was worse,
and sent me to bed, giving me something hot to drink; but
all that night I hardly slept, and in the morning he went
for Doctor O’Brian. By that time I had almost forgotten
the cause of my illness; what had led me to seek it; whether
I desired it to be fatal or not. I was examined, stethoscoped,
asked questions, gazed at. “Acute pneumonia.”
I caught the words through a kind of lethargy into which
I had fallen. They were talking together, my father and
the doctor, but neither could understand how the disease
had developed so rapidly....</p>

<p>And, after all, I failed! I did not die. I got better, though
not quite well, for my lungs remained delicate, and in
October Mrs. Carroll took me to be examined by a specialist.
I was examined, sounded, tapped, a sample of my blood
taken, and other odious things done to me, before it was
finally decided that I must go abroad. I listened to the
discussion that followed, taking no part in it myself, but
simply sitting on the sofa in the consulting-room.</p>

<p>“For the winter, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“For the winter certainly.”</p>

<p>“And afterwards?”</p>

<p>“Afterwards? I’m afraid it is impossible to say. There
is no use making promises which may never be fulfilled.
Would there be anything to prevent his living abroad
always, supposing it should be the best thing for him?”</p>

<p>“There is only the difficulty of his future—that is, of a
profession. He was to have gone to Oxford next year.”</p>

<p>“I see. It is certainly unfortunate. But apart from
that, there is nothing?”</p>

<p>“To prevent his living abroad? Not that I know of.”</p>

<p>There were such things as tutors, it then appeared; young
gentlemen of excellent scholastic attainments, just fresh
from one or other of the Universities, who could be induced
to combine the rôles of travelling-companion, mentor, and
pedagogue.</p>

<p>And on this hopeful note we came away. We had lunch<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_317"></a>[317]</span>
in town, and caught the next train home. When we arrived
at Newcastle we took one of the station cars. I was staying
at Derryaghy to complete my convalescence; so Mrs.
Carroll stopped at our house to give my father the news,
telling me to drive on by myself. The October sunlight,
still with a little of the warmth of summer in it, slanted
through the trees, as I drove in at the lodge-gate. There
was a charming autumnal languor in the still air—a kind
of dreamy, happy beauty, which made me think of some
verses of La Fontaine’s:—</p>

<div class="poetry" lang="fr">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“J’étais libre et vivais seul et sans amour;</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">L’innocente beauté des jardins et des jours</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Allait faire à jamais le charme de ma vie.”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="noi">And, far out on the dark sea, a white sail gleamed in the sun.</p>

<p>The thought of leaving it all behind me, and of passing
the rest of my life in exile, was too painful to dwell upon;
yet I knew that, once I went away, I might very easily never
be back. It had struck me that the doctor had been anything
but optimistic, and I knew this meant that my chance
must be a pretty poor one.</p>

<p>I went upstairs to my own room. I sat down in my old
window-seat and began a letter to Owen, which I did not
finish, for it occurred to me that, later on, I might have more
definite news to give him; and, at any rate, if I were going
away, he must come down first to stay with me. With my
incomplete letter before me I sat dreaming. I wondered if,
in years to come, another boy would have this room as his
own, and sit in this window-seat; and if his thoughts would
for a moment perhaps touch mine? All <em>my</em> thoughts
would be dead then; my dreams vanished; the life that
had unfolded here be gone out. A feeling of sadness stole
over me. I had been a very little chap when I had first
taken possession of this room. If the ghost of that little
boy, who had been me, could only come back, how I
should have hugged him! For I loved him: he seemed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_318"></a>[318]</span>
quite different from the “me” who was thinking about him
now. Only he was gone, and just one person in the world
knew anything about him, and he, too, I supposed, as years
passed would forget....</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“Why are you sitting up here in the cold, child?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Carroll had opened the door and was speaking to
me. “How long have you been here? Come down to
tea.”</p>

<p>I looked round and saw that the room had filled with
dusk. “Oh, not very long.” I smiled. “I’m not cold.”
But I shivered slightly as I spoke.</p>

<p>“That means you have been here ever since you came in.
It is really very wrong of you, Peter. The fire is laid, and
all you had to do was to put a match to it.”</p>

<p>I followed her downstairs. There was no one in the
drawing-room, and I was glad we were going to be by ourselves.
I sat on the hearth-rug, hugging my knees, gazing
into the red, glowing grate.</p>

<p>“Is Miss Dick out?” I asked.</p>

<p>“She went out to tea.”</p>

<p>I waited till the servant had come in and cleared away
the tea-things. Then I said, “I have something to tell
you.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Carroll, her plump, rather large hands moving swiftly
and deftly amid soft, fleecy wool, was knitting what looked
remarkably like an under-garment for me. “Yes, dear,”
she replied.</p>

<p>But instead of proceeding I asked a question: “Won’t it
cost a great deal, my going away—with a tutor, and all
that?”</p>

<p>“Not very much. It is of no importance.”</p>

<p>“But you will be paying for it, won’t you?” I urged.</p>

<p>“My dear child, why do you want to discuss such things
now?”</p>

<p>“I have a reason.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_319"></a>[319]</span></p>

<p>“I don’t think it can be a good one.”</p>

<p>“If I were related to you—if I were your nephew—it
would be different.”</p>

<p>“What would be different?”</p>

<p>“If I were worth it it would be different too. But I’m
not.”</p>

<p>“Aren’t you?” Her needles clicked placidly.</p>

<p>“Why should you think me so?”</p>

<p>“Because, I suppose, from the days when you were quite
a little boy, you have been the principal thing I have had to
think about. There was a time when I tried very hard,
and very selfishly, I’m afraid, to be allowed to look after
you altogether, when I wanted this house to be your home.”</p>

<p>“Suppose I told you that all this—all my illness—was not
accidental?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Carroll displayed no alarm. “I don’t know what
you mean, Peter, I’m sure,” she said, gently, disengaging
her ball of wool from Miss Dick’s cat, who had stretched
out a tentative paw.</p>

<p>“I mean that I did it myself,” I answered, bringing it all
out at last. “I did it on purpose.... I wanted to die, to
kill myself, and I thought of this way. I went out and lay
on the golf-links one whole night, in the rain, with nothing
on but my night-shirt; and next morning I took ill.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Carroll said nothing, but she had stopped knitting.
I felt her hand rest on my head.</p>

<p>“Is that true, Peter?” she asked at last, after a long
pause, and in a low voice.</p>

<p>“It’s true.” I stared into the fire.</p>

<p>She was again silent, but she did not draw away her hand.
“Why did you do this?” she asked presently.</p>

<p>“Because I felt miserable.”</p>

<p>“But—but it was a dreadful thing to do! Don’t you
know that?” Her voice trembled slightly.</p>

<p>I got on my knees. I put my arms round her neck and
pressed my cheek against hers. “I have spoiled everything,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_320"></a>[320]</span>
I made a mess of everything,” I muttered
quickly. “I am not very old, but I have made a mess of
any life I have had.”</p>

<p>She drew my head down on her breast and held me close.
For some time she did not speak.</p>

<p>“It will all come right, if you try,” she said at last. “The
beginning is not everything.”</p>

<p>“It is not for myself I care. It is for you.”</p>

<p>“For me, then.” She paused. “But for me you are
what you have always been and always will be, since I have
no boy of my own. You are my son, the one being whom
I love. Your future is what I think of and make plans for;
and whenever I pray it is that you may be happy.”</p>

“The Cliff End,” “The Doctor’s Lass,” etc. 6s.</i></span></p>

<p class="cap">A story of life at Spathorpe—perhaps the most beautiful and attractive
of all the watering-places on the English East Coast. Rupert
Brandor, a young and wealthy man, and a poet with some pretension to
fame, comes to Spathorpe to spend a few weeks of the season. Under
rather amusing circumstances he makes the acquaintance on the beach of
a young and very fascinating little girl, by name Bella Dysart, who is
staying with her mother at Cromwell Lodge—a large and well-known villa
on the esplanade. Bella’s personal charm and the unsophisticated frankness
of her disposition win the poet’s interest and affection. Shortly he
makes the acquaintance of Mrs. Dysart, and with her enters the new, and
deeper, and more dangerous element into the poet’s story. As the days
go by, the poet and Bella and Mrs. Dysart draw into a closer circle of
friendship. Meanwhile, they have come to be noted by Spathorpe’s busy
eyes. This beautiful woman and her scarcely less beautiful daughter, and
the handsome boy, attract a large measure of public notice; and the
inevitable whispers arise. Mrs. Dysart’s reputation suffers tarnish; her
acquaintance with the poet is construed according to the canons of the
world. Their uncloaked intimacy acquires the character of scandal.
From this point onward the action of the story accelerates. In the final
chapters it is a study in temptation, and the story occupies itself with the
youthful and poetic temperament under influence of seductive womanly
beauty and the counter-influences of a pure and girlish friendship.</p>


<p class="p2 noi"><span class="adtitle">Following Darkness.</span> <span class="adauthor"><i>By FORREST REID. 6s.</i></span></p>

<p class="cap">A study of boyhood and adolescence. The hero is the son of a
National schoolmaster in a village on the north coast of Ireland, and
the contrast of temperaments between father and son is from the beginning
strongly marked. A domestic tragedy having culminated in the disappearance
of his mother, the boy becomes the protégé of a wealthy lady
living in the neighbourhood. Her influence, and still more the influence
of her surroundings, of the house above all, which occupies a distinct place
in the story, tend to widen still further the breach between him and his
father. The advent of this lady’s niece, a charming girl who comes on a
visit, and by her presence transforms everything, introduces the element
of romance, and is the prelude to a story of first love, really the central
theme of the book.</p>

<p class="cap">The story moves in a Presbyterian village in Co. Antrim, in Victorian
days. Here Sally Bruce’s childhood is passed amid the kindly
austerity of old servants and an elderly uncle and aunts. Her acquaintance
with the Beausires, an old Huguenot family settled in the same
county, leads to the discovery of a kindred spirit in Anthony, the last of
the line. Their few meetings are the only outward events of her life, and
one spring morning in the Tinker’s Hollow they realize their love for each
other. Their lives throughout are interwoven with those of the Irish
country people—Rachael, the old nurse, Mrs. McGovern of the post-office,
and the unhappy young school-mistress, Esther Conway.</p>

of ethnology and native social problems, and laying stress rather upon the
theme that women as well as men may find a congenial place in the
frontier life, provided that they are of the right calibre.</p>
